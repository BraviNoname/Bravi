Disable in-game musics!!!

All osts that aren't Touhou are Pokémon or Kingdom Hearts osts. 

If they aren't from any of those titles, the game name would be displayed anyways.

Also, I don't think you'll have trouble finding the OSTs on youtube. That's what I do to play the osts.

Just so you get what's going on without relying on the ingame dialogue I have yet to make. Also, despite my decent english level, there can be some gramatical errors... Please don't be a grammar nazi. =<
Each incident takes place after the one corresponding to each game.

There's some abnormal heat around the Hakurei Shrine even if this is winter. The protagonists wonder where this comes from, and could only guess Noname's world.

Stage 1 :

The same Mushroom as before fell on the protagonists and got defeated. But, as they go through the Mystery Zone, Xenamon appeared before them, something being unusual, he felt that one of his originals are in danger, after testing the protagonists, he let them go down to Radiant Garden, where they can at least meet someone

Stage 2 :

This time, they had to dive into a cloud path to access the world, and they meet the Anti Black Coat again, who showed them the power of jealousy, only to lose.

Stage 3 :

Once they reached the bottom of the path, they ended up in Radiant Garden at night, as they keep going, they meet Lexaeus, who tried to buy some time, but failed and said this is a battle
he shouldn't have started.
Afterwards the protagonists found an entrance towards the Cavern of Remembrance.

Stage 4 :

In the Cavern of Remembrance, the protagonists met a red mushroom who's unlike any others, as it likes using dark spirits and wears purple marks on its clothing. Once it flew away, they meet Noname, hiding in this cavern who didn't wanted them to get involved this time as he told them it's too dangerous.
The protagonists told him they had to go through Hell once and they'll be okay. Noname wanted to know if it's true and challenged them via bringing recollections of their youkai partners, but got defeated, and wishes them good luck with their dodging endeavors.
He led them to the Burning Rear Castle That Never Was once this was over.

Stage 5 :

The castle is on fire, and the source of it must be at the bottom. The dark mushroom turned into Antinitas, who tells them he corrupted Nonamé, but he won't let them get any closer and fought them, and lost.

Stage 6 :

As the protagonists get warmer, they meet Antinitas who told them that's not of their concern, but got defeated at last. At the very bottom, they meet Nonamé, who has been influenced by Ansem's remaining darkness, which caused her to be corrupted by the Yatagarasu, and the protagonists had to seal it away. As Nonamé told them this Yatagarasu couldn't be destroyed, they engaged a fierce battle, and both lost. The protagonists had to get out of the area as Nonamé just overflowed and thus got rid of both the Yatagarasu and Ansem's darkness.

Ex Stage :

The incident seems to be gone, but the protagonists took a look near Nonamé's home, and meet Sanae, who tells them she ended up here while training at Transport to Remembrance and the protagonists were a target. She got defeated.
They meet then Nonamé who seemed to have become normal, and tells them nobody lost, but the protagonists told her that they didn't win either, and they have to get revenge on Nonamé. She accepts and fights them.
Once defeated, she admits even using the subconcious powers being her darkness wasn't going to make her win now, and she's already glad the shrine maiden or the magician lost once, even if she didn't win herself. Suwako suddenly showed up, as she was just checking if Sanae's training was going well.
And the protagonists told her they beat her. Suwako then tells them that's okay, she's only getting started, but one day she'll outmatch the protagonists.
