Disable in-game musics!!!

All osts that aren't Touhou are Pokémon or Kingdom Hearts osts. 

If they aren't from any of those titles, the game name would be displayed anyways.

Also, I don't think you'll have trouble finding the OSTs on youtube. That's what I do to play the osts.

Each incident takes place after the one corresponding to each game.

The seasons were messed up in the World that Never Was. Eirin told them Noname also went home from Eientei.
Meanwhile, Reimu and Marisa wanted to see him again to see if he's alright, Aya wanted to make an interview about him, and Cirno wanted to meet this dude to see if he's strong.

Stage 1 :

The summer heat is taking over the grassy fields. The protagonists met a replica of Cirno associated with this heat. After beating her, they continued.

Stage 2 :

As they made their way to the Door Road, the fall season seems to be there suddenly as they get close to the Dark City, they meet a replica of Aya, who acts in a rude manner towards the protagonists and attacked them, lost and guided them to the castle.

Stage 3 :

Cherry trees have grown in the Castle that Never Was just like at the Hakurei Shrine, they meet Mushroom XI who greets them with flower danmaku, and falls in defeat.
Afterwards, they meet a replica of Reimu, who tried to tell them that someone is after that appearance of herself and the other clones, after testing them, she guided them to the skies.

Stage 4 :

The Reimu replica points the protagonists towards the winter skies of this world, they meet Antinitas who spawned a clone of Marisa, and fled. That same clone Marisa fought the protagonists, lost and a door appeared on her back.

Stage 5 :

The protagonists ended up at the Transport of Remembrance filled with doors reminding them of the worlds under the season incident. they meet Antinitas and Noname, as the latter tried to find someone to join in so he can finally be faceless no more. As he has become faceless after being dragged out from Xehanort's grasp. He found Antinitas and had no choice to fight with him so he can get rid of the nuisance that is the protagonist. After getting beaten, a door has trapped the protagonists in.

Stage 6 :

That trap was a Door to the Mystery Zone made up by Nonamé, who told the protagonists they still didn't notice they were still using those season powers and that trap was going to make them lose. 
As she wanted to buy some time for Noname, she made sure they can't escape. She then forcefully fought them, making them visiting the seasonal places of their memories, and they lost because of her book to steal their powers and once the protagonists were forced to give up, they were sent back to their respective places.

Afterwards, she felt satisfied but sorry, but Reimu and Marisa enjoyed this battle and forgave her as she could win for once.
The protagonists still wanted to know what has truly become of Noname. They just took the border between seasons as they assume he will use the powers that god sage uses.

Ex Stage : 

The protagonists meet the Noname and Antinitas again at the Transport to Remembrance, and as they wanted to join in for good, they fought and as they lost, they merged and fled.
Once they catch up with Noname, who's expecting a rematch on him, he claims that he can use this seasonal power again to win, and he revealed his face, as a result with merging back with his other half, Antinitas, forever and mastering his darkness.
The protagonists told him they were gonna use the border between seasons to win. Noname said that this could be a possibility, he then opened his book which once upside down reveals a door, and attacks them, as he wants them to make it so he pays for Nonamé's unfair victory against them, but this time, with the back door powers, 
thinking of a merciless and vicious battle. He then lost and kind of accepts that. He also explained that not long after the season incident, Okina let her use her backdoor powers to freely move to Gensokyo without damaging the border, and she lend to both him and Nonamé the season magic.
