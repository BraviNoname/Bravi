Disable in-game musics!!!

All osts that aren't Touhou are Pok√©mon or Kingdom Hearts osts. 

If they aren't from any of those titles, the game name would be displayed anyways.

Also, I don't think you'll have trouble finding the OSTs on youtube. That's what I do to play the osts.

Just so you get what's going on without relying on the ingame dialogue I have yet to make. Also, despite my decent english level, there can be some gramatical errors... Please don't be a grammar nazi. =<
Each incident takes place after the one corresponding to each game.

Both Reimu and Marisa thought it would be some great opportunity to see Noname's world again, out of sheer curiosity, so they went through the corridor that showed up.

Stage 1 :

The door made the protagonists find their way into the same Door Road in which there is a out of place fall temperature, and they met Mushroom XIII again, who tried to imitate some harvest god's powers to test the protagonists again, but it got taken down.

Stage 2 :

Taking the Mushroom down led them to the Contorted City, where the Anti Black Coat made sure to make misfortunes fall on the protagonists, but it got taken down yet again.

Stage 3 :

The Contorted City led the protagonists to the Nameless Plain with a river at the middle, and some out of place fall trees, they meet Noname, who seems to have grown up, and is apparently embarassed to see them again. He told them not to keep going, or they'll fall into a trap.
As curious as the protagonists were, they insisted, and took Noname down, who used the Kappa's water powers.

Stage 4 :

As they rise the cloud falls, they meet Young Xehanort, without a word, who fled after having been taken down once again, to lure them to Xigbar. Once they arrived at the Memory's Skyscrapper, Xigbar greets them by explaining them 
this curiosity they had led them into a trap, as Noname said. Xigbar made sure the world sounds interesting, and after that, takes the protagonists on but lost to them. Only this time, the protagonists fell asleep.

Stage 5 :

The protagonists arrived suddenly at the Moriya Shrine, where they met Reisen. This seems strange, she used Sanae's techniques, but as the protagonists felt annoyed after the incidents Kanako caused, they had to attack
her, only to see that she's an illusion, just like the place they were in. Reisen told them this version of her is a Dream Eater made to protect Noname from the nightmare he's experiencing, then after vanishing, suddenly the protagonists came back to reality.

Stage 6 :

The protagonists woke up in the Contorted City, kept going on because their hearts were aching after what they did in that illusion, and assumed the responsible was beyond this. Xemnas, who just appeared in the Nightmarish Abyss before the protagonists, told them what
they saw was nothing but a dream. He wanted to make it so the witch and the shrine maiden would never wake up again and thus leave Gensokyo defenseless. The protagonists said they would never give in and win instead, and they fought Xemnas to get out of this trap, and won.

They were exhausted this time at the end, but Noname helped them getting out via a corridor, and forgave them for not listening to him.

Ex Stage :

Noname suggested the protagonists to come and fight him again, just for the fun of it, in Transport to Remembrance. There, the protagonists meet Xemnas again, who wanted to get revenge on the protagonists, but as he was the one getting weakened, he lost.
They meet Noname again, and there he wanted to show that he can use the Moriya God's powers, and he wanted to put his own versions of techniques. The protagonists also noticed the Sanae they saw earlier is from his dreams. Noname began questioning himself and fought in a desperate way.
After a rather long fight, he lost, he felt frustrated but it happens all the time as he said, and about those dreams, that might be true, but he feels uneasy when talking about this.
