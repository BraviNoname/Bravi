Disable in-game musics!!!

All osts that aren't Touhou are Pok√©mon or Kingdom Hearts osts. 
If they aren't from any of those titles, the game name would be displayed anyways.
Also, I don't think you'll have trouble finding the OSTs on youtube. That's what I do to play the osts.
But I recomment using thbgm changer.
