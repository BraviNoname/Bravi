This is some fanfic mod I've imagined since one or two years ago, and now, I'm able to do it.

The BGM are yet to be modded, you'll find a README.md file in each of the touhou folders.

Once I'll get the osts to be modded, ask me for the bgm.dat files.                        

These, and the dialogues are still yet to be done, but nowadays, I don't feel inspired... 

The stage logos and story summaries can give you hints about the plot.

About the dialogues :
- th06 : done

Image Credits :

- Marduk Kurios for the Keyblade backgrounds. 

- ZUN for the game itself. 

- Square Enix for inspiring me about the characters and the worlds, as textures were taken from in-game screenshots and renders. 

- Pokémon, Game Freak, Moe Harukawa and dairi for some character artworks, that I customized for some. 

- Book of Star Mythology staff for the Reimu and Sanae (<- hers have been customized) mini sprites.


Musics Credits (that have yet to be put in the mod, but as their musics have to be used to have some consistency for the bosses and stages) :

- ZUN 

- Book of Star Mythology, and Frantically Forbidden Fruit staff 

- Pokémon, Game Freak 

- Sonic Riders staff
