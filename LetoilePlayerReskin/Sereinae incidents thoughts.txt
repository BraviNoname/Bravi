Jolty introduces Sereinae to a memory-based simulation of most of Gensokyo's past incidents, there, Sereinae must use a memory-based card that replicates the powers of whichever protagonist(s) she chooses,
and she cannot talk with any character, only watch the protagonist talk with their opponent(s), and she's forced to dodge with her own skills alone (that is without the agility-based abilities given by Jolty).

Jolty suggested this challenge to Sereinae to hone her dodging skills and depend on him a bit less and to witness whatever happened during those incidents.

Sereinae's thoughts about each windows maingame incident, including those that are not part of the mod:

- "Sounds like this vampire was bored. I have to say, her witch friend is very studious, I admire her dedication!"

- "Spending a night with just the glow of the blossoming cherry trees around me... It's so peaceful, I love it! A question though: why didn't that sage stop her friend? If this incident was going to cause that friend's own loss that is..."

- "They came from the the actual Moon? I thought it had no atmosphere to breathe in and be livable. Hm... But nowadays, they've been of a huge help to me regarding healthcare for example, they have my thanks!"

- "Now that's a shinigami unlike I've ever seen. They usually have a black outfit. I heard the many flowers appeared due to something... rather tragic, in Japan."

- "Now, now, Sanae, is that how you approach people? You can't just come in and shut down the only shrine in Gensokyo besides yours. What matters is that you acknowledge the mistake. Besides, aren't there many of these shrines in the Outside World?
   That's okay if there's more than one shrine around then, isn't it?"

- "And one of your goddesses caused some additional troubles. I get that you want to bring a new source of energy to Gensokyo, that's wonderful! But this went a bit too far...
   I heard there is a satori, a mind-reading youkai, living down there. Is reading minds similar to reading feelings? It's not like I could read someone's mind."

- "I think Hijiri wasn't familiar at all with Gensokyo, and came from another era. Her past should explain why she thought youkai were oppressed, and I'd understand that, 
   it's just that in Gensokyo, things are different and that must be why the incident solvers attacked her."

- "Don't those spirits look a lot like you Jolty? They're soon-to-be gods?! And Bad-Jolt called you the god of your own world. This all makes sense...! 
   And with this marks the near-end of the Domino effect made by Kanako Yasaka in person. Sorry, no hard feelings!"

- "This drum lady taught me how to shoot thunder lasers. Isn't it cool? More seriously though, considering what happened to the incident solvers' weapons, I'm never considering Jolty as a tool for combat. He's a living being just like me, let's not forget!"

- "They were raiding the Lunar Capital who were raiding Gensokyo. If that spirit knew the Lunarians would do that, things would've happened differently. This spirit, she has no name, just like you before I gave you the name of Jolty.
   My take on the Hell Goddess's fashion choice is that since she's high status, she deserves to have a more extravagant outfit similar to greek gods. Either she doesn't like that and prefers simplistic clothes or she didn't think about it.
   She's free to come by, I'll be glad to sell her a new hand made outfit if she wants one!"

- "This God I used to serve once wanted to make herself known, therefore making herself not secret. I understood though that there's much mystery surrounding her that gives her a certain sacred aspect.
   I wonder if she has anything to do with Kokoro, with the mentions of Noh. Guess we'll never really know!"

- "This city is like our world, but you'd hate to live there as a human spirit, and I heard the atmosphere there is suffocating. I wonder if this is one of the places human criminals end up in. I'd still understand their decision to revolt by summoning a god,
   and I get how exhausting it is to work nonstop. Imagine then if your entire life is spent like that, and you're a possible prey to animal spirits. They just wanted better life conditions."

- "The cards were nothing to dangerous in the end, but I understood the worries of the incident solvers. This Market God... Can she make an illegal market become legal? No way she'd let it be, not if she sees the bad consequences coming.
   I've also seen there's a great tengu who uses the power of the starry sky, that's so pretty, I'd do the same thing, use stars everywhere gracefully and swiftly...!"

- "Speaking of consequences, that's something she probably hasn't seen coming. Reimu, you're lucky this oni chose you in the end! I don't know what would've happened if this oni kept Gensokyo for herself."

Sereinae's thoughts about each windows spin-off incident:

- "That winter was too long and the spring too short. She just wanted to make up for that, no need to make such a ruckus about it!"

- "Taking pictures of danmaku is something I should do as well, for practice and fun, I guess!"

- "Are all celestials like her? Wanting to cause trouble because they're bored and have a big ego? No way, this must be just her..."

- "Building a giant robot? What for? I'm curious! Same goes for that giant doll. By the way, I get this must be boring for a gatekeeper to do her job while no one's ever coming."

- "She's the one who brings newspapers and interviews to everyone. One day, there will be TV news in Gensokyo as well!"

- "Like Jolty said, fairies can be cruel, and this war shows it very well!"

- "Ah, Reimu, taking advantage of an incident for your profit! Hata no Kokoro is doing well. She doesn't need her masks to show her emotions to me, that's convenient, and she's full of them."

- "The coming of another outsider in Gensokyo. This incident was one of the biggest crisis Gensokyo could've ever known. She's really reckless sometimes, but I like how passionate she is! We're almost like a duo with our glasses!"

- "I feel bad for that poverty god, really. I wish I could help her, but first she needs to keep her bad luck ability in check. Don't want myself to be unlucky!"

- "Do we really spend our dreams in another world? I thought it was just our brain's thoughts during our sleep. Bringing your physical body shouldn't be possible then. Maybe in Gensokyo, rules are different, and such world can exist."

- "I'm more than glad petroleum hasn't become a resource in Gensokyo. Now I just wonder if the Outside World will be able to never use the petroleum again... Our world doesn't use it as much, which is why its sky has become more clear."

- "Climbing Youkai Mountain is fun, isn't it? I don't get which between black and regular market is right in Gensokyo. Even the Moriyas are profitting from the black market. 
   I guess that it's just because it's not governed by the Market God and uses a different currency that it is considered a black market. Outside World black markets are... kinda different from what Jolty told me."
