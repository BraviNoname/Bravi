Disable in-game musics!!!

All osts that aren't Touhou are Pokémon or Kingdom Hearts osts. 

If they aren't from any of those titles, the game name would be displayed anyways.

Also, I don't think you'll have trouble finding the OSTs on youtube. That's what I do to play the osts.

Just so you get what's going on without relying on the ingame dialogue I have yet to make. Also, despite my decent english level, there can be some gramatical errors... Please don't be a grammar nazi. =<

Each incident takes place after the one corresponding to each game.

As their weapons are still alive, Mushroom XIII warned the protagonists about an incoming Keyblade war, and this can only happen if the Castle that Never Was gets upside down and items are still acting up, this Keyblade war can bring all worlds to an end because of one man wanting the X-Blade.

Stage 1 :

The protagonists ended up in the sea around Destiny Islands, fought Demyx after not meeting him for so long and then ended up in a strange city.

Stage 2 :

The protagonists flew to Twilight Town, where they meet Xenamon, who wanted to spend some time in this town with the sunset. The protagonists wanted to access the World that Never Was to know what's going on, Xenamon told them after getting defeated how to and showed them a corridor.

Stage 3 :

As they arrive at the castle, Saïx told them they don't accept the protagonists's inteference, and attacked them with the power of the moon that is the false Kingdom Hearts above the castle. He lost and the protagonists went on.

Stage 4 :

The protagonists were soaring in the dark skies, and found Noname and Nonamé, who felt quite annoyed and edgy, they attacked the protagonists, Nonamé has been defeated, Noname fled, and the protagonists followed him.

Stage 5 :

At the castle turns upside down, Noname has his perverse side awakening, and wants to use his reversed tricks on the protagonists without any reason, and he fled again once defeated.

Stage 6 :

The protagonists arrived at the Keyblade Graveyard leading corridor, where they meet Noname who was in fact guiding them to help a former friend... That is Seija Kijin. What is that former friend ? This amanojaku caused nothing but trouble. She had once a good
side which made her a worthy Keyblade wielder, but has been manipulated by her evil amanojaku half who has been split from her, represented by Antinitas. As they forcefully joined together, 
Seija wanted the Keyblade war to begin so it brings the Miracle Mallet back from the light within Kingdom Hearts, X-Blade in hand, she attacked the heroines whether if they refuse teaming up
with their tsukumogamis, or out of sheer frustration if not equipped. She wanted to make them feel small and vice versa.

Ex Stage :

Who wanted to make this war begin ? The protagonists went through the same dark skies, met the Nameless Duo (name for Noname and Nonamé together), and they tried to test the protagonists, who passed.
Once rising through those dark skies, they meet Ansem, yet again, who convinced Seija to make the X-Blade and make Gensokyo fall. As he didn't want to fail again, he attacked the protagonists with all his might, and after a viciously long battle, he lost and vanished.
