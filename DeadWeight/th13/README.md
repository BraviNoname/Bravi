Disable in-game musics!!!

All osts that aren't Touhou are Pokémon or Kingdom Hearts osts. 

If they aren't from any of those titles, the game name would be displayed anyways.

Also, I don't think you'll have trouble finding the OSTs on youtube. That's what I do to play the osts.

Each incident takes place after the one corresponding to each game.

The protagonists, along with Youmu, learned Noname wasn't going well... At first they underestimated this, but it seemed it was way more serious.

Stage 1 :

The protagonists meet a naturally matured Nonamé at the Dark City, as she planned. She wanted to test them, where Nonamé wanted to see if they're ready to face Noname's darkness. She told them that this heartless might be back, after something bad happened to Noname, which caused darkness and dark desire spirits to appear. But suddenly as she was about to be taken down, the protagonists fell asleep.

Stage 2 :

The protagonists woke up on a route near the Home that Never Was. Here, Nonamé showed up again to check if their abilities were alright after falling asleep. And once defeated, she thought about Youmu and her swords being of good use, as well as Reimu's amulets. She led them towards the Contorted City.

Stage 3 :

At the Contorted City, the protagonists were following Nonamé, who couldn't face the threat who was protecting an entrance towards Noname's heart. As she couldn't go further, she challenged them once again, but her light spell was too feeble, and she let the protagonists go.
Going further, they met a shadowy other, who telepathically told them that Noname was going to get extinguished by his own darkness, then it attacked the protagonists, and vanished once defeated.

Stage 4 :

A door appeared when the Guardian has been defeated, the protagonists went through it, and met Ansem, Seeker of Darkness, who is only a lingering foreshadow who wanted to possess Noname. Him, and his Guardian fought seperately, and lost, told them the real him will return, before vanishing.

Stage 5 :

The protagonists were transported to a place named Dive into the Heart, they meet Antinitas, and Antinitasé, who both wanted to torment Noname again so they might dominate him. They wanted the protagonists to fear their powers, and then they lost.

Stage 6 :

An access to the deepest part of the Dive into the Heart has appeared, the protagonists wanted to know what's going on in this place. A grownup version of Noname appeared, telling them the stainglass isn't there, meaning his heart maybe has been shattered, and the only way
to solve this problem was to destroy him, he pointed out Youmu's sword and Reimu's amulets and told her to use those against him. He fought using light techniques and the shattered pieces around him to attack, he then lost, but was expecting this...

The protagonists went back to reality, and Reimu figured out Noname was feeling better from her aura check. He thanked them and told them to come anytime they want, as always.

Ex Stage :

Transport to Remembrance, a place where something strange was going on : a mirage version of the previous version of Castle Oblivion, being Land of Departure exists in it, and the armor of a former teacher has been seen. Nonamé came back but she wanted to see if they were ready for this test, and the protagonists wanted to know what this armor is. 
This Armor is the lingering willof Master Eraqus, who wanted to give another challenge to the heroines, it has been defeated by them, using light danmaku and reflecting Reimu's techniques and told them they passed.
