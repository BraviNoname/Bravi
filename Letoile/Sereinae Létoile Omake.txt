Human of the Dream City

Sereinae Létoile (セレイナエ・レトアル)



General information:

Age / Size : Over 22 / 163cm
Species : Human
Gender : Female
Eyesight : Varying between decent and bad 
Personality : Quite joyful and friendly, has a strong fashion sense due to the variety of clothes she makes and wears. She can also be playful, teasing people. The problem being that she tends to meddle in others’ affairs too often… She enjoys reading too.

Abilities of Sereinae:

- High-level of empathy: Can understand how the others in her vicinity feel, making her a potential therapist if she wants to...

- Has also acquired high skills at dodging attacks if helpless. Though she has yet to improve her stamina…

- Can make clothes for cosplay, mainly of other characters, just to see if they fit her, and show them to others.


Common ability of both Sereinae and the Spirit:

- Use of various danmaku styles: Unlocks Sereinae’s and the Spirit’s true potential when both are in unison. Uses mainly thunder-elemental attacks, but she can also use other elements. Sereinae’s attacks have stars included in the mix. 

Abilities of the Spirit:

- Restricting another person’s strength : While he unlocks Sereinae’s potential, he can immobilize an opponent if they happen to be a deadly threat.
- If alone, he can take a more human shape and wield thunder-related abilities, but it never lasts long until he reverts into a spirit form.

Background information:

Lives in a dark city with a beautiful starry sky, which is unnatural for one. Sometimes this city sees the light of the day but it is pretty rare. She spends her time at home, taking care of her usual house business. 
There are rare times where she goes to other worlds to see more people outside her own. It isn’t always good to stay everyday at home after all, especially when you don’t see the light of the day often.

In her life, she takes care of the Spirit that she has around her, and wears a hair clip shaped after him (the Spirit) as a special token of appreciation. 
He is rather shy, thoughtful, quite honest, and doesn’t hesitate to act recklessly when he deems the situation calls for it. 
It has the ability to restrain someone’s powers by taking hold of their being. 
He uses this in case he faces a too-aggressive opponent, in order to either flee or calm them down.

The history of that city is tied to that Spirit, tightly. Sereinae’s origins remain a mystery. One might tell the Spirit imagined her along with the city, another one can tell she was naturally born as a human being, that the whereabouts of her parents are unknown, 
and, after she grew independent from them, she decided to stay in the city after she saw this lonely Spirit.

Her last name, Létoile, meaning “the star” in french, is the name she had since birth, and represents her as a symbol of hope for both her and the Spirit, no matter the circumstances.

The incident of the Dream City:

The following stories are told from Reimu’s position as the protagonist.

It was a darker night than usual, the skies, once covered with stars, got covered by dark clouds. Once Sereinae and the Spirit found the source behind this, they found out to be helpless, the malicious being behind this is undefeatable by them. 
The Spirit can barely restrict its power, but enough to make it defeatable… But not by Sereinae’s hands alone. As a matter of fact, if the Spirit takes hold of it, Sereinae can’t use her abilities because of his absence. 
They decided then to quickly retire while they could.

The dark clouds spread within the city until it gets covered in total darkness, as if it got submerged by it, and eventually seeped into Gensokyo, in the shape of a dark blue and pink miasma on the ground, causing the shrine maiden to react. 
She first guessed that the Scarlet Devil Mansion group was behind it, but, when seeing where the clouds came from, she changed her mind and headed to their actual source. Once she ended in the city, she found it familiar, 
because of the Outside World vibes, but something didn’t feel right. 
Once she met Sereinae, she tried to explain the situation, but Reimu still wanted to go on to find the culprit. 
The girl then challenged the shrine maiden, not only as a test of strength, but also because they don’t want the situation of their own world to cause collateral damage. Once Reimu won, she kept going with the Spirit following her behind, per Sereinae’s orders. 

Once she arrived at the source, the shrine maiden saw the Spirit behind her, and wondered why he came along. After hearing his explanation, she then laughed and said she could defeat anybody with spell card rules around, much to the Spirit’s surprise at her ignorance. 
The being behind this doesn’t abide by the spell card rules at all, and is impossible to defeat. Although… The Spirit’s ability can make Reimu able to win with his ability, or at least to make it abide by those so called rules, but the dark being is still a tough opponent, 
even with the Spirit’s possession to restrict it. Reimu finally agreed to this plan, as the Spirit called this a “nice teamwork!”.

Once destroyed and the city returned to normal, Sereinae followed Reimu to see if everything was back to normal in Gensokyo. To their good surprise, it is. The girl apologized to the shrine maiden for the inconvenience. 
Even though Reimu said she does this all the time, Sereinae doesn't believe it, and wants to reward her because it doesn’t seem right to just get away with this that easily, especially when someone else had to be dragged into this because of their powerlessness. 
Reimu asked for donations, but Sereinae asked if this question was honest. Then both of their stomachs rumbled, so Sereinae baked her own special meal and they both ate. This was so strange, for the shrine maiden to get something for solving an incident…
The origins of that dark being are mysterious. It was in the dead center of the city. As mentioned earlier, the city may have been the Spirit’s imagination, or dreams. This dark being would then represent the nightmares and fears in its mind...

Secret God Event (might canonically clash with the current mod):

The following is a minor event that takes place after the previous incident.

The Spirit noticed Sereinae went missing for a few days, without even being told anything about it from her or coming back. He looked for her everywhere through the city, but still didn’t find her. 
He decided then to take the same path she took to go to Gensokyo, the same passage the clouds took to get there, to ask Reimu about her whereabouts, but in vain, she didn’t see her at all. Reimu knows what he has done to help her, 
meaning she has no reason to attack him. Having nowhere to go, he decided to stay at the shrine during the daytime, while still going back home during Gensokyo’s nighttime, only to still not find Sereinae there.

After thinking for a while, Reimu realized that this isn’t normal at all, after all, why would she leave for a while knowing she needs to go back home after being gone for over that many days? 
This sounds like an incident, but on a too small scale to be called so. They decided to take action and, since this recalled her certain memories of children getting supposedly kidnapped, she then looked for a certain door. 
On the way forward, she kept protecting the Spirit to help him avoid harm.

Once they arrived at the Land of the Back Doors, they noticed Sereinae was trying to fly away from a woman sitting on a chair. They overheard the conversation, and the lady said 
“I know you have potential, I can sense it, though I’m disappointed even I can’t unlock it. As if there was a lock on it, meaning a key is required for it.”. 
The Spirit wondered what she meant by that and decided to jump into the conversation, much to Sereinae’s happy surprise.

She explained how she ended up here : once she passed a door in the back of their building in the Dream City as a shortcut back home, she ended up in this land instead, with no way to escape as the door she took was locked, 
then two dancers and a “creepy lady” challenged her, even though she couldn’t fight back, making her forced to just survive their attacks, one after another. It was later revealed that this lady wanted her as a new servant to replace her current ones, 
especially after having seen how Sereinae dodged the bullets with a grace that isn’t that far from a dance. Still, the girl refused, deciding that she will always stay true to the Spirit.

The lady then introduced herself as Okina Matara. She claims herself to be the reason why the dark clouds found their way into Gensokyo, through the door Sereinae took to get to Gensokyo and by extent the Land of the Backdoor. 
The secret god sees a strong bond between the girl and the Spirit, then suggests they combine their powers in order for them to challenge her, making it essentially a test. 
She also insisted that Reimu shouldn’t partake within the fight as it would interfere within said test, and made her busy by making her face her two current servants. Sereinae saw them before, and admittedly guessed their outfits would fit her!
Once she can use her true power, much to Okina’s delight, seeing her potential finally unlocked, they then fight.

Upon winning, they passed the test, but Sereinae still stayed true to her decision and decided to go back home, only leaving Okina behind, disappointed. The girl’s final word to this is that if Okina wants it that way, 
the girl can still assist the servants once in a while, that is, if she asks her nicely, the thing being that, she can’t leave the Spirit behind. 

The girl thanked the shrine maiden for protecting the Spirit on their way here. Reimu didn’t mind about it that much, except for the fact she was left aside to fight the servants while the two others were fighting their bosses directly. 
Sereinae asked how she could make up for it.
This time, the girl didn’t hesitate and invited Reimu’s friends and other people so that she could share the food with others.

Other Sereinae Event:

The canonicity about the past existence of the following character in Sereinae Létoile’s story can’t truly be confirmed!
It is confirmed in the other Sereinae’s story.

While Sereinae was doing one of her random Gensokyo tours, she stumbled into a house at the edge of the Human Village, the Serene Hostel. There she made a surprising discovery…

She met a girl who looked exactly like her, as if she was looking at a mirror, only the reflection had different clothes… The other girl who met her just greeted her the usual way, but something was wrong. 
Once the two introduced themselves, their first names happened to be the exact same!

They kept asking each other questions, for each answered question, the other Sereinae remembered more and more about her past… 
Sereinae Létoile is just any ordinary human, with a last name, but the one who stood in front of her is nothing but the creation of a Secret God once made to serve her, and has no last name. 

That creation not only got made from 13 Gensokyo characters, her appearance and personality are defined from someone else’s too! Realizing there’s absolutely nothing that can make her unique, her own self, 
she became so overly upset and thought in the end that only one of the two girls can exist… Even though Reimu tried to interfere, they both accepted their challenge, and fought against each other for the first and last time outside of 
Gensokyo for them to be unbound by the spell card rules, while keeping the shrine maiden away from it. 

Said shrine maiden wanted to save both of them, to her eyes, no one had to die, but she couldn’t. Unlike Sereinae, she couldn’t understand how the other one felt, that is to say, 
upset to the point of slaying the only thing that prevents her from being her own person.

There was one crucial difference between the two, one difference that made the original Sereinae stand out during the fight, and could make her a more viable servant… Her superior skills at dodging bullets. 
That gave her the upper hand in the entire fight. Her movements looked as if she was dancing frantically around the bullets, which was all that the Secret God wanted…

Realizing the fake one failed at that purpose, she had no choice but to go away for good, return the essence that made her to the 13 Gensokyo characters, and her defined appearance go back to the real one’s. 
Before going away, the original girl still recognized the other’s skills at singing, and would like to get into it for both of their sakes. Those 13 characters can still retain a certain familiarity from looking at Sereinae’s face, but won’t ever be able to recall why. 
And after all, this isn’t a big deal for them.

The real Sereinae then decided to make these events a complete secret, and took over the Serene Hostel, working it in, hiring people to work for her while she’s away. 
She has to keep it open after all! She also thought about making some business with the clothes she makes there.

In the meantime, there were still some questions she had to ask the Secret God, such as, why she was so desperate to hire her that she made a servant who looks like her. 
Sereinae wasn’t really mad at her, she rather found that ridiculous, and sought to fight her again just for that story. The four of them still got along pretty well after all of that. 
She offered to periodically help Mai and Satono, just as some sort of legacy of their relationship with the other Sereinae.

Some months later though, Sereinae wanted to resign from her part-time job as a servant, she had cosplaying and making and selling clothes as a business after all. 
And...things seemed off, that those three have a relationship that didn't really exist, it was with the replica after all, not the original. And they ended up learning about the original Sereinae being party responsible for the replica's demise at some point.
Yet, both Sereinaes looked like each other a lot.
Sereinae may have at first sensed some sorrow coming from the secret god for having lost her creation, she didn't sense any remorse from her for what she has done : giving life to a replica who suffered the fact she couldn't ever become someone 
who isn't her own self, and whose identity and life is taken from someone else's. This caused the girl to become more and more disgusted about Okina as time went on and was the true reason why she decided to quit.

Okina made it clear that if Sereinae chooses to resign, then she wouldn't be able to use her doors to freely go to Gensokyo and see Mai and Satono again. While she didn't mind about the former, as she would likely find an alternate way to go to Gensokyo,
Sereinae still wanted to challenge her to a spellcard duel, where if she won, Okina would then have to allow Mai and Satono to see her again sometimes, just not to leave her behind, alone with the Spirit. She couldn't blame them for having to obey Okina's orders.
