Abilities of Sereinae:

- High-level of empathy: Can sense any of people's emotions and feelings. She prefers focusing on only one person's emotions, just to not overload herself. 
  This makes lying to her usually useless because she knows your emotions go against what you say, and therefore can sense how legitimate someone's words or actions are.
  This ability has made her emotionally intelligent as she mastered it, which she uses to help those she cares about.

- Good homemaker and skilled at making clothes. She makes clothes for cosplay or for sale.

Abilities of Jolty:

- Using his imagination to create worlds, copies of worlds, and their people. The copies of worlds he creates are generally faithful to the original ones, albeit with some differences.
  "It's like how an author imagines the world a story takes place in, along with the characters."

  - Became able to create his own artificial body once.

Abilities of Jolty's Spirit Form:

- Has possession-related abilities:

  - Restricting another person’s strength: can immobilize an opponent when they happen to be a literal deadly threat to Sereinae.
  
  - Ability to protect Sereinae from whichever other spirit might possess her, and expell them from her mind.
    While inside of her mind, Jolty unlocks his true potential, and fights against the spirit with all his might. While they fight, Sereinae enters a state of temporary comatose. 
  
  - Grants abilities to Sereinae:
  
    - Use of thunder-related attacks: Unlocks Sereinae’s and Jolty’s true potential when both are in unison. Uses mainly thunder-elemental attacks.
      Sereinae’s attacks tend to have stars included in the mix. Can also fight in melee with her orbs turning into ethereal blades in each hand, which are made out of electric energy.

    - Gains some agility and mobility: Acquires high skills at dodging attacks. The electric abilities acquired from Jolty allow her to become very reactive to whatever attack is thrown at her (similar to spasms). 
      She becomes more and more exhausted the longer she uses this ability, due to being human. Gains ability to float with the aid of an already floating spirit.

    - This possession can have Jolty's personality influence Sereinae's, as they share in the same body. 

Abilities of Jolty's Human Form:

- Ability to manipulate thunder and use it for heavy, ground-shaking attacks. Unlike Sereinae, he isn't as agile with his body, but his reflexes are still decent.

- Has learned to share some his power with Sereinae, making her able to use some of his lightning powers and floating abilities with her already learned fast battle style, while still able to maintain his human form.
  This ability has been developed much recently.

Backstory and general information:

Lives in a dark city with a beautiful starry sky, which is unrealistic for one. This city sees the light of the day once every two days. Although it is influenced by the outside world, it isn't quite that.
Therefore those unnatural and unrealistic sides of the city gave it its name as the Dream City, although this name has another deeper meaning...

During her childhood, her ability prevented her from being a bully or a cruel person, as she would feel the sadness or anger of those she would target. She then used to avoid meeting sad people as it would make her sad as well, and wanted to meet happy people instead.
She wished to snap out of it because she felt compassionate. She believed that if she made them happy, they would make her happy in return. It was a reason for her to become a therapist, but her parents were too scared for her.
Facing people's negative emotions can weigh on her emotions because of her ability, but she is convinced that if she can help them fix their problems with this job, it won't be so bad after all. This ability is a double-edged sword.
She now studies to become a therapist and have the best use of her main ability, therefore she got the idea to use her cosplaying hobby as a way to relate to other people more, by more or less literally getting in their shoes.
Her studies help her understanding the human psychology better.

Her parents didn't really allow her to live the lifestyle she wanted and were scared about what she planned for her future, and also wanted to learn how to live independently, so she moved away once she came of age. 
She however agreed with them that she shouldn't stay with someone unless she knows they care about each other a lot. She doesn't care about short-lasting relationships at all.
During her teenager life, she had more like a peachy personality, becoming friends with her classmates, but never developing or engaging in any love relationship during that time.
As consequences, deep inside, she didn't know how to properly approach someone who would eventually have feelings for her, or the other way around.
After parting ways with her friends after graduating from high school, she lived a solitary life, stayed in the city, and learned how to live independently as she wanted. 
She still studied and worked part-time, yet prefers focusing on her hobbies when she can, to relieve the pressure.

There are times where she wishes to go to other worlds to see more people outside her own. She has a curiosity about whatever's going on around her and beyond.
Her other hobbies include making new clothes, having a strong fashion sense due to the variety of clothes she makes and wears, either for cosplay or for sale. She also likes making city tours when she's not at home.
She also happens to like reading at times, and had once thought about the job as an idol, but realized the job takes too much of her liberties, taking hold of even her private life, and besides, she learned that there's maybe another way to put a smile on people's faces later on.
She resignated to that idea, but still admires the idols' work. Besides if she wanted to, she wouldn't be able to, she doesn't have the beauty standards according to the producers to become one, one more reason to give up on this project.

Each time she ran errands, she stumbled multiple times upon a atypical being in the shape of an orb, with two white eyes.
Each time she did, she felt loneliness from this being. She turned a blind eye to it for some time, but ended up not to, her ability made it too difficult.
She saw it wandering aimlessly, and one day wanted to help him and was curious at the same time about it. If this was a time to practice with therapy with someone, it was right now.
She used that opportunity to learn how to control her ability and avoid getting overtaken by negative emotions. 
It has the ability to speak and one time Sereinae was surprised how it could sip a cup of tea without any hands or mouth. It complained about how people find it creepy and no one wanted him around.

Sereinae remembered about her current solitary life once she started moving out of home. On the long run, this kind of life has started affecting her negatively too, so she is able to sympathize with it.
Their loneliness is what brought those two people together. Sereinae then initially thought of it as nothing more than a pet, given how cute she finds it. 
She sensed its worries nearly vanishing as soon as it was on her side, so things are working out in the end. 
In return, Sereinae has learned how to be less worried with it around in return, feeling reassured near him.

After seeing each other several times, and getting things off their chests, they decided to stay together, because they had an emotional connection.

In exchange of allowing it to stay, she got thunder-based abilities from it. She jokingly said this would help with the electricity bill, and... she wasn't that wrong about it, honestly.
They got even closer to each other with time passing by, and Sereinae's ability made understanding him easier, while she gives him daily meals that he likes, and later they became sidekicks.
The orb introduced itself as the Spirit, a male one, he said this name would define him the easiest, but Sereinae didn't agree and found the name too generic. She decided to call him "Jolty" from now on. 
He guessed it corresponds to its ability and how shaky it sounds.

The reason Jolty had become bodiless soul wasn't clear. It was assumed it was a human before. When asked about it, he would rather feign ignorance or carelessness.
When Sereinae asked, she sensed that he wasn't comfortable with talking about it, so she decided not to force things. 
 
During their daily life, she takes care of Jolty like in a sort of family. She made and wears a hair clip shaped after him as a special token of appreciation, and guessed it'd be nearly insulting to treat him like a mere pet.
With Jolty's influence, Sereinae grew a slightly nerd-ish side too, gathering more or less useful info about anything they want. With time they both take interest in each others hobbies, and started to visit worlds outside their own to expand their horizons.
When she saw he is truly a human, she remembered about her vow not to form relationships during her teenage years, but since she knows they take care of each other, she can make this time an exception.
At one time she stopped treating him like a pet as a consequence. 

During their time in Gensokyo, Sereinae asks Mokou for guidance through the Bamboo Forest in case she needs to go to Eientei for medical matters. Mokou, at first, mistook her for her enemy Kaguya, but not any longer.
Later on she started to make and wear a new outfit for each time she goes to Gensokyo, trying to blend in with the human society of Gensokyo. However, they never want to take a drink, alcohol isn't their thing at all.

Due to their adventurous and curious side, they also search info about whatever events or incidents that already took place, much to the people's fears that they might find too much out, 
but for them, it's like more like reading a story book while being less ignorant about whatever is or has been going on.

With all she has learned about Gensokyo's society, she avoids wanting to become the therapist of Gensokyo. If she helped her patients become more rational, knowledgeable, and how to deal with their fear,
she would in the end cause the decline of the youkai population, due to having less villagers fear them, thus a big incident. She made that a promise to the incident solvers that she would only help those in her world.
Jolty and Sereinae also vowed to make it so that they're the only ones able to traverse worlds from their own to other worlds, including Gensokyo. Jolty isn't sure that he can trust the other dwellers of his world to not make mistakes.

She proved that with knowledge comes wise decision making for the greater good, instead of a mean to an end for one's benefit. Still, she mentioned how cruel it is to leave people in ignorance like this.
Jolty interprets this as how the food chain works, only this time, humans have something above them, which ironically, comes from them. Unlucky for them, they're born in a ranch from which they cannot escape.
Gensokyo is somewhat like a place that is stuck in the past, to him.

She related to how people from the outside world get accustomed to Gensokyo's life style, such as the Moriya Shrine, and actually admires them for such feat.
She frequently asked them for advice, and visited the shrine. ...by climbing the Youkai Mountain instead of taking the ropeway, thinking it'd be good for her health.
Jolty likes it when she cosplays as Sanae, so, Sereinae frequently wears her cosplay of her when at home, him associating the green, blue and white colors with serenity.

Sereinae sometimes wonders if this clothing holds more value than her own person to him. But Jolty replies that if it did, then he'd stay with Sanae, and that her clothing adds to Serei's appearance and person, rather than replaces those.
Sereinae doesn't want her cosplays to seriously change who she is: she still holds on to her person and changing it is not the purpose of her cosplay. In the cases where she changes her personality, then it's just some non-serious roleplay.

Jolty learned that the gods at the Moriya Shrine were planning to become gods related to technology, then bragged to Sereinae about the fact their city is technologically more advanced and more modern than whatever he saw in Gensokyo, 
but he still highly respects their projects related to such thing and guessed he could learn a few more things from them. 
Sereinae, on the other hand, got to talk with Kanako and noticed that she is different and more caring than Okina was, and supposed the gods aren't all the same.
She became friends with Sanae due to their shared interests and common knowledge from the world outside, although she noticed that Sanae is behind the times, after all it has been ages since Sanae left her homeworld, the Outside World,
but she didn't mind it as it made Serei and Jolty nostalgic. She jokingly said her meeting with Jolty might have been the fruit of a miracle, even though Sanae isn't sure if she did anything about it. 

She eventually met Sumireko at some point near the Hakurei Shrine, Sereinae and Jolty both noticed there was something wrong about that human, and realized she was a doppelganger, and the real Sumireko is in the Outside World,
they got along rather well, and unlike Sanae, Sumireko wasn't behind the times at all, and they noticed how much things have changed from back then to now in that world.

While lurking at the Myouren Temple, Sereinae asked Byakuren to do some exercise for her agility skills, after she has done so for her physical strength with Jolty.
This is most likely a sign of admiration to that monk, who can fly at very high speeds and become very strong with her magical abilities.

Jolty once asked if Sereinae wanted to become a youkai for her physical limits, but she refused: she still dislikes her limits, but at the same time, she cannot afford to give up on her humanity and change herself forever, and guesses Marisa thinks like that as well.
She also mentioned how much of a hassle it would be for her to try to become one, that she would become a target for Reimu to exterminate, and that she has other things in life that matter (implying Jolty and their future). 

Cosplay-wise, Sereinae found a way to dye her right sidelock according to the character's hair color. She considers it as making it less complicated when it comes to cosplaying as characters whose haircolor is too different compared to hers.
She wouldn't use it that often though.

All arcs and incidents listed below take place between Wily Beast and Weakest Creature and Unconnected Marketeers, and thereafter.
The BraviOCOkina (but th18) and SereinaeAlt mods are canon to these stories, unless specified otherwise.

The incident of the Dream City:

The following stories are told from Reimu’s position as the protagonist.

It was a darker night than usual, the skies, once covered with stars, got covered by dark clouds. Once Sereinae and Jolty found the source behind this, they found out to be helpless. Their opponent turned out to be too strong for them, or anyone.
Jolty can barely restrict their power, but enough to make them defeatable… But not by Sereinae’s hands alone. As a matter of fact, if Jolty takes hold of it, Sereinae can’t use her abilities because of his absence. 
They decided then to quickly retire while they could.

The dark clouds spread within the city until it gets covered in total darkness, as if it got submerged by it, and eventually seeped into Gensokyo, in the shape of a dark blue and pink miasma on the ground, causing the shrine maiden to react. 
She first guessed that the Scarlet Devil Mansion group was behind it, but, when seeing where the clouds came from, she changed her mind and headed to their actual source. Once she ended in the city, she found it familiar, 
because of the Outside World vibes, but something didn’t feel right. 
Once she met Sereinae, she tried to explain a bit of the situation. Reimu then thought to keep going towards the source of the incident, but Sereinae refused, as she said she had tried to take down the culprit but couldn't.
Reimu assumed Sereinae was weak, and she answered with a fight. Not only she wanted to keep her from going to avoid having the situation make more victims, she wanted to test her strength when she sensed her confidence.
Once Reimu won, Sereinae explained the situation even further, gave her directions, and had Jolty follow her behind to ensure she's safe.

Once she arrived at the source, the shrine maiden saw Jolty behind her, and wondered why he came along. She thought of him as a divine spirit.
After hearing his explanation, she then laughed and said she could defeat anybody with spell card rules around, much to Jolty’s surprise at her ignorance. 
Their enemy doesn’t abide by the spell card rules at all, and is impossible to defeat. Although… Jolty’s ability can make Reimu able to win with his ability, or at least to make it abide by those so called rules as she calls them.
Reimu finally agreed to this plan.

Their opponent appeared before them, recalling the time Jolty ran away, before introducing himself as the other part of Jolty. Which Jolty dubbed as "Bad-Jolt" for some reason.
Unlike him, he has an actual human body, of a hooded young man with red eyes and purple patterns on the bottom of the pants and near the edge of his sleeves.
He looked annoyed by the fact Jolty and Sereinae had to rely someone else to face him. Considering Sereinae useless and worth throwing aside, and he would be better with someone else, and laughed about the name she gave him.
Reimu, as honest and direct as she is, said out loud that she had been dragged into someone else's internal problems, she then thought about nothing but beating her opponent as usual, 
but when thinking twice, she added that Jolty shouldn't throw Sereinae aside, she noticed back then that they were trusting of each other, and finds it weird that part of him would reject her. 
She doesn't know that much about their relationship, but she can't stand for that Bad-Jolt badmouthing her either, and she knew Jolty is a human soul.  He provoked Reimu to see if she can face someone else's inner demon.
Jolty just let a loud sigh, things were clear to him, he still intends to stay by Sereinae's side. He reminded Reimu of her initial decision to beat their enemy and rushed through his other part, restricting her strength into making Reimu able to win.

Once defeated, he made the city return to normal as a sign of guilt, but still claims he is right about Sereinae, and invites Jolty to prove himself that she is worth having around.
Jolty guessed that the reason he was such a dangerous and unbeatable opponent, was because of Bad-Jolt's stubborness. And only Jolty could stop what is essentially himself.
Serei heard about the story afterwards, and felt sorry for both of them. She will try to give him the tools to deal with it, like any therapist would. 
The first thing being that he should try understanding why he is so untrusting towards her. What is the exact thing that he fears from her? That she might not be enough for him? Does he think he deserves better?
Factually, he has no reason to fear her, but she still sensed he is too stressed about it, so she swore she will play her part in reassuring both of them.
Additionally, she guessed any kind of people has their own other self inside of them, which seems to be in this case Jolty's subconscious.

Sereinae followed Reimu to see if everything was back to normal in Gensokyo. To their relief, it is. 
The girl apologized to the shrine maiden for the inconvenience. Even though Reimu said she does this all the time with a smirk, Sereinae didn't believe it, and wants to reward her just to clear her mind.
Reimu then asked for donations, but Sereinae asked if this question was honest. Then both of their stomachs rumbled, so Sereinae baked her own special meal and they both ate. 
This was so strange, for the shrine maiden to be offered something for solving an incident…
It was from this moment onwards that Sereinae started to take interest in Gensokyo, starting to wander in this world, and her world, on occasions.

Secret God Arc (might not be considered canon due to clashing with the Sereinae Replica Arc):

The following is a minor event that takes place after the previous incident.

Jolty noticed Sereinae went missing for a few days, without even being told anything about it from her or coming back. He looked for her everywhere through the city, but still didn’t find her. 
He decided then to take the same path she took to go to Gensokyo, the same passage the clouds took to get there, to ask Reimu about her whereabouts, but in vain, she didn’t see her at all. Reimu knows what he has done to help her, 
meaning she has no reason to attack him. Having nowhere to go, he decided to stay at the shrine during the daytime, while still going back home during Gensokyo’s nighttime, only to still not find Sereinae there.

After thinking for a while, Reimu realized that this isn’t normal at all, after all, why would she leave for a while knowing she needs to go back home after being gone for over that many days? 
This sounds like an incident, but on a too small scale to be called so. They decided to take action and, since this recalled her certain memories of children getting supposedly kidnapped, she then looked for a certain door. 
On the way forward, she kept protecting Jolty to help him avoid harm.

Once they arrived at the Land of the Back Doors, they noticed Sereinae was trying to fly away from a woman sitting on a chair. They overheard the conversation, and the lady said 
“I know you have potential, I can sense it, though I’m disappointed even I can’t unlock it. As if there was a lock on it, meaning a key is required for it.”. 
Jolty wondered what she meant by that and decided to jump into the conversation, much to Sereinae’s happy surprise.

She explained how she ended up here : once she passed a door in the back of their building in the Dream City as a shortcut back home, she ended up in this land instead, with no way to escape as the door she took was locked, 
then two dancers and a “creepy lady” challenged her, even though she couldn’t fight back, making her forced to just survive their attacks, one after another. It was later revealed that this lady wanted her as a new servant to replace her current ones, 
especially after having seen how Sereinae dodged the bullets with a grace that isn’t that far from a dance. Still, the girl refused, deciding that she will always stay true to Jolty.

The lady then introduced herself as Okina Matara. The door Sereinae took to get to Gensokyo and by extent the Land of the Backdoor were the reason the dark clouds ended up spreading to Gensokyo.
The secret god sees a strong bond between the girl and Jolty, then suggests they combine their powers in order for them to challenge her, making it essentially a test. 
She also insisted that Reimu shouldn’t partake within the fight as it would interfere within said test, and made her busy by making her face her two current servants. Sereinae saw them before, and admittedly guessed their outfits would fit her!
Once she can use her true power, much to Okina’s delight, seeing her potential finally unlocked, they then fight.

Upon winning, they passed the test, but Sereinae still stayed true to her decision and decided to go back home, only leaving Okina behind, disappointed. The girl’s final word to this is that if Okina wants it that way, 
the girl can still assist the servants once in a while, that is, if she asks her nicely, the thing being that, she can’t leave Jolty behind. 

The girl thanked the shrine maiden for protecting Jolty on their way here. Reimu didn’t mind about it that much, except for the fact she was left aside to fight the servants while the two others were fighting their bosses directly. 
Sereinae asked how she could make up for it.
This time, the girl didn’t hesitate and invited Reimu’s friends and other people so that she could share the food with others.

Sereinae Replica Arc:

The canonicity about the past existence of the following character in Sereinae Létoile’s story can’t truly be confirmed!
It is confirmed in the Sereinae Replica’s story.

While Sereinae was doing one of her random Gensokyo tours, she stumbled into a house at the edge of the Human Village, the Serene Inn. There she made a surprising discovery…

She met a girl who looked exactly like her, as if she was looking at a mirror, only the reflection had different clothes… The other girl who met her just greeted her the usual way, but something was wrong. 
Once the two introduced themselves, their first names happened to be the exact same!

They kept asking each other questions, for each answered question, the other Sereinae remembered more and more about her past… 
Sereinae Létoile is just any ordinary human, with a last name, but the one who stood in front of her is nothing but the creation of someone, but told nothing about who they are.
That creation not only got made from a bunch of Gensokyo characters, her appearance and personality are somewhat defined from someone else’s too! Realizing there’s absolutely nothing that can make her unique, her own self, 
she became so overly upset and thought in the end that only one of the two girls can exist… 

Létoile doesn't want anyone to die because of her. Usually she accepts challenges for fun and fights seriously only when necessary. But having to face someone with a near mental breakdown is something new to her.
She tries as best as she can to comfort her, telling her that they have their differences, either being about their talents, abilities, or experiences, or what they even are in the first place, that this makes the replica unique.

The Replica insists over the fact some people find her creepy, that they don't really like her for acting too familiar with them or knowing too much about them, so she has been forced to feign ignorance.
Létoile thinks it isn't necessarily the Replica's fault. While it might be rude in the first place to act familiar towards people that consider her as a stranger, this is still Gensokyo, a world where common sense works differently,
that is to say, something or someone weird might be totally normal, and should be socially accepted. Something that Létoile finds strange, ironically. Out of compassion for the replica, Létoile chose to attack anyone who would badmouth her.

The replica chose, more or less willingly, the side of humans from the beginning, even though she is part youkai due to her being a replica of certain ones. This is why it made her unconfortable to scare them.
She made a choice then. That is to get out of Gensokyo, since even here she didn't feel welcomed anyways, even if she wasn't really one to blame. Létoile accepted her decision, and had her stay in the home back in their world.
Their world happened to be very similar, if not, the exact same as the one where the Replica once fought the protagonists during the Four Seasons incident. But Létoile had no idea that the Replica was around during that time.

The replica had also the choice to have her give she unwillingly stole from others: their life essence, but Létoile refuses, and thinks it's for the best for her to stay alive, she doesn't have to do this.
Afterwards, Létoile would still try to offer her some help, as a "friend", about her identity crisis.

She remembered the replica talking about certain dancers, twin dancers, she asked her about them, and wished to see them. They were in fact friends with her.
Once she got to the Land of the Backdoors, she offered to the Secret God to periodically help Mai and Satono, just as some sort of legacy of their relationship with the replica, while the replica chose to stay away.

Later, Létoile took over the Serene Inn, working it in, hiring people to work for her while she’s away. 
Létoile has to keep it open after all! She also thought about making some business with the clothes she makes there, from time to time while working for the Inn side.
She doesn't want to put the replica into any business in Gensokyo, true to her decision.

Some time later though, Sereinae planned one day to resign from her part-time job as a servant, she had cosplaying and making and selling clothes as a business after all. 
She started asking herself who was the replica's creator. There was a probability the Secret God was involved in this, but she usually recruits people from outside.

She challenged Okina in order to have her spill the beans about it. If she lies, Serei will know it. After an exhausting fight as a rebellious servant, Sereinae ended up narrowly prevailing.
Okina Matara rewarded her with the truth, that she was indeed the replica's creator, made in order to avoid recruiting from outside. 
The Secret God ended up firing her, believing it would be too cold-hearted to just destroy her. Additionally, she also let her leave Gensokyo with the backdoor that links it to their world.

However Létoile didn't sense any remorse from Okina for giving life to a replica who suffered the fact she couldn't ever become someone who has an own identity. 
This caused the girl to become more and more disgusted about Okina as time went on and was the true reason why she decided to quit, not her other hobbies and businesses, just this.

Okina made it clear that if Sereinae chooses to resign, then she wouldn't be able to use her doors to freely go to Gensokyo and see Mai and Satono again. While she didn't mind about the former, as she would likely find an alternate way to go to Gensokyo,
Sereinae still wanted to challenge her to another spellcard duel, where if she won, not only, she'd have to let Serei leave, Okina would have to allow Mai and Satono to see them again sometimes, both Létoile and the Replica, in order not to be kept apart forever. 
For now she couldn't blame them for having to obey Okina's orders. Serei doesn't even know if it was their choice to serve Okina or if they were forced.

After announcing the news to the Replica, she was brought to tears of happiness to see her old friends again.

Jolty's New Body Arc:

Sereinae after a while was becoming tired to do everything in her house alone, with Jolty around not being able to do anything to help. She wished then that he had a human body to help.
She supposed that if Jolty is a disembodied human heart and soul, then that would mean he can host a human body himself.
Jolty responded that it would not be okay to just steal someone else's body to do it, and to that Sereinae agrees. He wasn't against the idea of having a human body, after all that time, deep inside, having a body in starts missing him, in that world.
He also wishes to become the one who is the most reliable among the two, and make Sereinae the one he'd protect and look after. His abilities granted to her, for both offense and defense, are one proof of that wish.
It is a wish made also to be more secure about himself.

After brainstorming for a while, they thought about asking the puppeteer from the Forest of Magic, but she, being Alice, answered that she only makes puppets, and wouldn't be able to make it feel real even if it was human-sized.
They've tried doing their own research on the human body, if it required magic to create one for example, how to make a blank body which shape and flesh would adapt to the heart and soul inhabiting it. 
They gave Alice the idea about it in case they'd need to use magic. It would take long until they find an effective way to create one, gathering as much info and help as they can to make things possible, or understand the whole thing at the very least.
In the case everything failed, they'd get someone more experimented to do it for them.

Sereinae then saw Jolty alongside a body that looked artificial. Sereinae wondered how he found one, or why he hasn't talked about it sooner.
Jolty then responded that he just imagined one and, poof, one ended up appearing, not knowing how it was possible in the first place. But if there was something he knew, is that he felt desperate.
Serei thought about how crazy it sounded, but believes him, since she sensed that he's telling the truth.
Sereinae made the outfit for him, more or less based on Bad-Jolt's, and, although it took time for her to get used to his new appearance, 
Afterward she made a beanie for him, based on a certain protagonist's design that he likes. It was a spiky beanie with a black band, on which there are two white spots, meant to refer to his spirit form. He wears it during winter.

Despite having this new appearance, Jolty would spend most of his time outside with his hood up, probably because he isn't quite used to his new human appearance, and is too bashful about showing his face at all time. 
Sereinae accepts this behavior, but thinks it is no good in front of people that would suspect him of being part of some sort of criminal organization for example just because of that hood.

Both were embarassed looking at each other, Sereinae in front of a man, and Jolty looking like one, But she recognized him with his everyday attitude.
Regrarding the help she could get from Jolty, she's going easy on him at the moment, until he gets used to aiding her on his own. 
It took time for Jolty to get used to controlling his own body like it was natural. He loses balance easily and has trouble getting up in a second, so Sereinae took things with patience.
He mentioned it was as if he was an old man being helped by his granddaughter. He shook that idea off, he can't stay frail and weak forever, especially if he wants to stay true to his wish.
While Sereinae fondly appreciates his efforts, sometimes this worries her. She doesn't want him to be overworked because of her.

Jolty now has a new body, he has one reason less to stay with Sereinae, but, after all the time they spent together, and the fact she still needs him, he decided to stay anyways. It was out of the question to leave.
They really formed a relationship after all that time, and Sereinae has stopped taking him for her pet much before he gained his body.
He pointed out that with his new body, Sereinae can't use the fighting abilities from him that she uses. He suggested to teach her to defend herself in case he can't be there to help her, to which she replied that they're not in a hurry,
that when the time will come they will practice physical combat.

When they tried to go to Gensokyo, they noticed that they can't bring Jolty's body to Gensokyo through their newfound alternate way, that is, Wishing Portals, where they made sure that only the two of them can use them, fearing that curious people may abuse it,
much to the incident solvers' ire. They must also find a way to keep that body safe from eventual danger. Sereinae recalled another sage who can use gaps to get anything she wants easily, and they both wouldn't like that body to serve as food for youkai.
Jolty then had the idea of asking Reimu to put a seal over that body to repel the youkai while he and Sereinae are gone to Gensokyo. She only has to accept after all.

With an actual human body, Jolty now has to get a job of his own to provide for both of their needs. Sereinae still doesn't abandon the idea of studying to become a therapist, and Jolty encourages it, as it can help them in their everday lives.
New job means temporary absence, and also the need for Sereinae to be able to defend herself when in need, This was the opportunity for her to train.

Future Plans Arc:

Jolty earned a job as the one who manages the City, after showing what he was capable of doing to the recruiters while Sereinae started to remember what her parents said about becoming a therapist. 
She wondered if it was worth to stop studying and instead stay at home to keep making and selling clothes.
He asked her if her studies helped her more than anything, to which she responds that she has gained skills in understanding others, but she also remembered about the fact she might have to face her new patients's negative emotions once she ever starts.
Jolty reassured her by reminding her that she had gained control over her own abilities in the past and that nothing should go wrong, 
He noticed that her control over the ability made her react less emotionally and more rationally. It never makes her respond coldly to anyone though, which is why he thinks she's fit for the job.
Jolty on the other end seems to respond too coldly to people, and Sereinae thought about having him work on that.

He was worried about the fact that if both work with a full schedule, they might not see each other very often, and someone would have to stay at home to take care of it, either it be in their world or Gensokyo. 
Sereinae reminds him that the fact they think of each other is what matters the most, it's no big deal if they don't always see each other.
She is aware that some women around her age want to stop their carreer and become housewives and thought of becoming one when the time comes.

After a lot of thinking, they've decided themselves: when Sereinae graduates, she will stay at home, and turn a room of their home into an independent office, while Jolty keeps working at his daily job.
They tend to spend their vacations in Gensokyo or other worlds to see how the others are doing. If they couldn't do it for whatever reason they would still play games together.
Sereinae also said Jolty didn't have to worry about his wage now, if he needs to get another job for a lighter schedule for less wage, or do remote work then he can with no worries. 
She doesn't mind about them not being the richest people in the world for example, and besides, she still sells clothes. She said she would make it her main career if her career as therapist would go nowhere for her.
She added that she would use her skills to make clothes for idols, and even become a designer for them. She has a long way to go for both that and the therapist carreer.

And regarding Sereinae's own combat abilities, Jolty has thought about the possibility of sharing his lightning powers and some of his floating abilities with her, 
that way they can battle on their own in case they need to split up and not have Sereinae be a damsel in distress when alone. She didn't want that either so she went along with it.
She will first practice how to fight in melee, before using that power. Once they've started practicing, Jolty noticed her potential, how she tends to always strike first and be capable of evading his blows.
He guessed while they were in unison her body got used to fast and sudden movement. But then when it came to power, he guessed either she was holding back to not hurt him, or that was the best she could do.

Sereinae answered this by pulling out a serious punch, which Jolty blocked in time, and to his good surprise, it was powerful, well enough for her to be no small fry. This put a smile on his face.
He noted that the more powerful the punch is, the more range and power the lightning she will spread from her fist will get. 
With a smug he noted this will never be as powerful as the hammer kick he performed on the ground, or the abilities they use in unison with him as a mere orb, remark to which she answered with a pinch on his cheek, but she admits he is right.
He tries to reassure her that she still has good potential, and her practice as a former dancer helped a lot for that.

From that day onward they just focused on their daily activities: their hobbies and jobs. The days they go to Gensokyo were becoming more and more rare and they started to miss the people back there.
Jolty wished he could have a body in Gensokyo, but it still isn't possible unfortunately, so he will always stay an orb that is a vulnerable yet reliable sidekick for Sereinae in that world.

Worlds Created by Imagination Arc:

Upon browsing on their computer, Jolty came across the fact Gensokyo exists as a media, and its story is told and written. He had Sereinae take a look as well, and she noticed that the stories told included the people they met there,
but not the two of them. When browsing through the story, Sereinae noticed that for example, she has never been Okina's servant, and Okina hasn't created a Replica of her. 

They asked themselves a lot of questions afterwards. If the Gensokyo from this story is told from a omniscient person, if this Gensokyo is the real thing that they cannot set foot on, and about the
Gensokyo they visit. They guessed that if the Gensokyo that is told in that media is the real thing, then the Gensokyo they visit must probably a copy, a copy in which they can be present.

They noticed that in this story, the Gensokyo they saw isn't told about as a media in the Outside World from that same story. 
For that they had to visit the Outside World and see if it is right, but even that Outside World is a copy of that of the original story. And they saw no trace of Gensokyo existing as a media, except the social media pictures Sumireko posted.
The Outside World is supposed to be traced on the real world in that story. Jolty revealed to Sereinae that he was originally from the Outside World too, well, his original self that is. 
He remembered that Gensokyo exists as a media in that world as well, so it's not the same as the Outside World related to Gensokyo.
They sooner or later noticed they can come to this Gensokyo at any timeline of the original thing they wanted and reset things at will, that's how Jolty sooner or later realized he could joke around there if he wanted.
But since Jolty has a conscience, he never thinks what he does is guilt-free, so he refrains from going to far, and Sereinae always reminds him and herself that, even if she herself finds it funny to tease people.

Jolty wondered if this applied to the many other fictional worlds they visited. He found out that originally, they exist as medias they're not part of, either as games or movies, so it is very likely that the
worlds they visited are mere copies, alternate universes as others called. They try to be optimistic about it, saying they can still have their fun paying those people a visit, but Jolty reminds Sereinae they shouldn't
do that to flatter their egos, and treat them the same as they are. The two of them are just happy ordinary people when it's not about their combat abilities and powers.

Altenatively, Jolty wanted to talk about something else.

He was quick to assume the city they live in was a fruit of his imagination, and its inhabitants mere figments, despite how human they are, but Sereinae didn't want to believe it,
she claims that she can't be his imagination, as she is standing right in front of him. Jolty may have worded things wrong though and thought it was hurtful, and Sereinae tried to understand why he assumed things that way,
but despite Jolty being bashful about it, Serei thought he may have had something to hide, and he reminded her about the manifestation of Bad-Jolt, and how it affected the city and other worlds, why he had
the eyes of a nightmare. He guessed that if he affected the city that much, it would be because both of them have ties to this city, and wondered why its name was Dream City. He wondered if he was the one dreaming.

He wondered who created the copies of these fictional worlds and their inhabitants. It cannot be a Gensokyo sage, and Jolty thinks that if the Dream City is a product of his imagination, then maybe those fictional worlds are his imagination as well.

Sereinae booped him and told him this overthinking made him all hungry and tired. She told him he is not dreaming as long as she will be there, and that she'll stay by his side.
This answer made Jolty think that Sereinae is missing something out, that he worded things wrong. He figured out that if the Dream City has ties to him, then Sereinae's existence may depend on his since she is native from the Dream City.
Sereinae thought about it for a while, and she concluded that she depends on him way more than she thought. But if that's what she's supposed to be, then she'll have to be of a good support towards him.
Jolty reminded her that he's here for her too.

He, however, feared that if something tragic were to happen to him, the existence of everything around him would logically collapse on itself. Sereinae pointed out that he was scared, wondered why, and Jolty had no choice but to tell her.
Sereinae just had the simple idea of keeping him safe for as long as she can. Jolty thanked her, and remembered that he was originally in an orb shape. 
He addtionally guessed their idea of getting him have a human body was one way to keep himself safe and protect Sereinae, in return.

After theorizing for a very long while, they sought out to find the truth about it, and went back to the location at which he and Reimu faced Bad-Jolt, based on the probability that he might know something about it.
Bad-Jolt appeared in front of him, and confirmed their thoughts, knowing about the city more than Jolty does, that the power of his imagination created this world and copies of the worlds he liked.
He added it's nothing harmful, the same events as the original story's world happened in the copy, and the people were the exact same. Nothing from the copy could influences the original world, not even a Gensokyo sage's abilities.
The other worlds related to Gensokyo, such as Makai and the Land of the Backdoors, and all the people and sages were also revealed to be copies of those of the original story.
The only things that were changed from the original world were Jolty's, Sereinae's, and her replica's existence in Gensokyo.

Sereinae almost felt like crying knowing her friendship with Mai and Satono has been a total lie, and is friends with fakes of them. Jolty reminded her that it's no big deal that they're "fakes", as much as this is true, they're still people.
She can still have fun with them, and things would be no different if she was with the original ones. She added that it would still be pointless to befriend fakes. Jolty understood it would feel better if she got along with the real ones,
but he thinks being with the copies is just as good, since after all, they're exactly the same.

Bad-Jolt would call Jolty the God of the Dream City based on the fact he created it out of his imagination, but Jolty would reject that idea, embracing the fact that he's just any ordinary dude who happens to be strong. 
He has Sereinae, and to him that is all that matters.
Jolty remembered what Reimu said about him being a divine spirit. At first he thought it was a misconception, but she was most likely right. After all, as a shrine maiden she knows a whole lot about gods and divine spirits.
While Sereinae appreciates his modesty, Bad-Jolt found it to be a shame, saying that he could use that fact to be praised and worshipped by the inhabitants of the city, and that Sereinae would fit the role of his priestess. 
Sereinae takes it into consideration for a roleplay idea, but plans nothing too serious about it, and while Jolty likes that idea, he still isn't too enthusiastic about the fact he might be a God of the world he lives in.
Besides, he thinks anyone could create a world out of their imagination, therefore become a so-called god of that world.

Jolty remembered that it was most likely this ability of imagination that created his own artificial body.
He also wondered why he imagined himself as an outcast even in his world. 
Maybe it correlates with the fact he doesn't want to see himself as being praised for something that is realistically impossible, and unconsciously imagined that world's society as traced over the real world's.
He doesn't want to lie about what he truly is, that is to say, a dull and ordinary human, inside.

He doesn't want to see himself as the creator of the people around him, he will only consider childbirth as something that comes from couples, not creation by imagination.
Therefore both him and Sereinae do not see Sereinae as Jolty's making, and wish this whole creation from imagination was a tall tale. 

They got the information from Sanae that gods can split their divine spirits and be summoned by their shrine maidens, like she summons Kanako and Suwako.
Serei then wondered if she can do the same and summon Jolty's help, and Jolty answers by the fact he has shared his powers with her, and that it can be an equivalent of summoning a god's help as a shrine maiden.

Sooner or later, Jolty would have to accept what he truly is to this world. Serei reassured him that he can accept it, without changing who he is, to her at least, i.e. the person closest to her in her life.
