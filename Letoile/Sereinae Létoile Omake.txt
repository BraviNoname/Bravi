Human of the Dream City

Sereinae Létoile (セレイナエ・レトアル)

Nameless and Sparkling Dark Spirit

Jolty (ジョルティ)

General information:

Age / Size : Over 22 / 163cm
Species : Human
Gender : Female
Eyesight : Varying between decent and bad 
Personality : Joyful, friendly, and playful. Remains calm most of the time, and tends to take an elder sister/mother role with those around her age.
She tends to meddle in others’ affairs too often and that she can be too forgiving or selfless for her own good.
Likes : Her hobby, taking care of herself and the others around her.
Dislikes : Her fatigue, having no freedom, and to a lesser extent, the irrationality and immorailty in others,

Abilities of Sereinae:

- High-level of empathy: Can sense people's emotions and feelings. She prefers focusing on only one person's emotions, just to not overload herself. This makes lying to her usually useless because she knows your emotions go against what you say.

- Can make clothes for cosplay, mainly of other characters, just to see if they fit her, and show them to others. She sells whatever clothes she makes as a job too.

Common ability of both Sereinae and Jolty:

- Use of various danmaku styles: Unlocks Sereinae’s and Jolty’s true potential when both are in unison. Uses mainly thunder-elemental attacks, but she can also use some other elements sometimes. Sereinae’s attacks have stars included in the mix. 

- Acquires high skills at dodging attacks. The electric abilities acquired from Jolty allow her to become very reactive to whatever attack is thrown at her. She becomes more exhausted the longer she uses this ability, due to being human.

- Gains the ability to float with electromagnetic power.

Abilities of Jolty:

- Restricting another person’s strength : While he unlocks Sereinae’s potential, he can immobilize an opponent if they happen to be a deadly threat.

- If alone, he can take a more human shape and wield thunder-related abilities, but it never lasts long and then reverts into a spirit form.

Abilities of Jolty's Human Form:

- Ability to manipulate thunder and use it for heavy, ground-shaking attacks.

- Unlike Sereinae, he isn't agile with his body, but his reflexes are still decent.

Background information:

Lives in a dark city with a beautiful starry sky, which is unnatural for one. This city sees the light of the day once every two days. The appearance of the city could be misinterpreted as the outside world, but isn't.
There are rare times where she goes to other worlds to see more people outside her own. It isn’t always good to stay everyday at home after all, especially when you don’t see the light of the day often.

Her hobbies include making new clothes, having a strong fashion sense due to the variety of clothes she makes and wears, either for cosplay or for sale, she had the idea to use it to relate to other people more, among other ideas.
They also happen to like reading at times. With time they both take interest in each others hobbies.
Later on she started to wear another outfit for each time she goes to Gensokyo.

She had once thought about the job as an idol, but realized the job takes too much of her liberties, taking hold of even her private life. She resignated to that idea, but still admires the idols' work.
She would also think in the future about studying in order to become a therapist and have the best use of her main ability.

Her parents didn't really allow her to live the lifestyle she wanted, she moved away once she came of age. 
She lived a lonely life, stayed in the city, and learned how to live independently. She still studied and worked part-time, but cared more about her hobby.

Each time she ran errands, she stumbled multiple times upon a atypical being in the shape of an orb, with two white eyes.
Each time she did, she felt a strong sadness from this being, and felt the need to help him. She turned a blind eye to it, but couldn't keep the facade for too long, her ability made it too difficult.
She asked it if it was okay after she saw him shed a tear, and it asked itself where it should go, it said itself it had no purpose and kept wandering the city in circles, and everyone else finds it creepy or odd.
It is rather shy sometimes, thoughtful, quite honest, and doesn’t hesitate to act recklessly when it deems the situation calls for it. It lacks some of the empathy Sereinae has. 
It has the ability to speak and one time Sereinae was surprised how it could sip a cup of tea without any hands or mouth.

Upon discussion, Sereinae learned that both have a solitary life, and, after they've said goodbye once or twice, she suggested him to stay with her, like a sort of pet, it gladly accepted. 
This would keep to both of them company, ridding them of their solitary lives, and besides, she finds it cute.

This led her to keep it with her and in exchange she obtained the ability wield thunder magic. She jokingly said this would help with the electricity bill, although she wasn't that wrong about it.
They got even closer to each other with time passing by, and Sereinae's ability made understanding him easier, to the point they would become sidekicks.
The orb introduced itself as the Spirit, a male one, he said this name would define him the easiest, but Sereinae didn't agree and find the name lame. She decided to call him "Jolty" from now on. 
He guessed it corresponds to its ability and how shaking it is.

In her life, she takes care of Jolty that she has around her, and wears a hair clip shaped after him as a special token of appreciation. They both grew a slightly nerd-ish side too, gathering more or less useful info about anything they want.

During their time in Gensokyo, Sereinae asks Mokou for guidance through the Bamboo Forest in case she needs to go to Eientei for medical matters. Mokou, at first, mistook her for her enemy Kaguya, but not any longer.
She related to how people from the outside world get accustomed to Gensokyo's life style, such as the Moriya Shrine.

Her last name, Létoile, meaning “the star” in french, is the name she had since birth, and represents her as a symbol of hope for both her and Jolty, no matter the circumstances.

The incident of the Dream City:

The following stories are told from Reimu’s position as the protagonist.

It was a darker night than usual, the skies, once covered with stars, got covered by dark clouds. Once Sereinae and Jolty found the source behind this, they found out to be helpless, the malicious being behind this is undefeatable by them. 
Jolty can barely restrict its power, but enough to make it defeatable… But not by Sereinae’s hands alone. As a matter of fact, if Jolty takes hold of it, Sereinae can’t use her abilities because of his absence. 
They decided then to quickly retire while they could.

The dark clouds spread within the city until it gets covered in total darkness, as if it got submerged by it, and eventually seeped into Gensokyo, in the shape of a dark blue and pink miasma on the ground, causing the shrine maiden to react. 
She first guessed that the Scarlet Devil Mansion group was behind it, but, when seeing where the clouds came from, she changed her mind and headed to their actual source. Once she ended in the city, she found it familiar, 
because of the Outside World vibes, but something didn’t feel right. 
Once she met Sereinae, she tried to explain the situation, but Reimu still wanted to go on to find the culprit. 
The girl then challenged the shrine maiden, not only as a test of strength, but also because they don’t want the situation of their own world to cause collateral damage. Once Reimu won, she kept going with Jolty following her behind, per Sereinae’s orders. 

Once she arrived at the source, the shrine maiden saw Jolty behind her, and wondered why he came along. After hearing his explanation, she then laughed and said she could defeat anybody with spell card rules around, much to Jolty’s surprise at her ignorance. 
The being behind this doesn’t abide by the spell card rules at all, and is impossible to defeat. Although… Jolty’s ability can make Reimu able to win with his ability, or at least to make it abide by those so called rules, but the dark being is still a tough opponent
even with Jolty’s possession to restrict it. Reimu finally agreed to this plan, as Jolty called this a “nice teamwork!”.

Once destroyed and the city returned to normal, Sereinae followed Reimu to see if everything was back to normal in Gensokyo. To their good surprise, it is. The girl apologized to the shrine maiden for the inconvenience. 
Even though Reimu said she does this all the time, Sereinae doesn't believe it, and wants to reward her because it doesn’t seem right to just get away with this that easily, especially when someone else had to be dragged into this because of their powerlessness. 
Reimu asked for donations, but Sereinae asked if this question was honest. Then both of their stomachs rumbled, so Sereinae baked her own special meal and they both ate. This was so strange, for the shrine maiden to get something for solving an incident…

It was from this moment onwards that she started to take interest in Gensokyo, starting to wander in this world, and her world, on occasions.

Secret God Event (might not be considered canon due to clashing with the Sereinae Replica Event):

The following is a minor event that takes place after the previous incident.

Jolty noticed Sereinae went missing for a few days, without even being told anything about it from her or coming back. He looked for her everywhere through the city, but still didn’t find her. 
He decided then to take the same path she took to go to Gensokyo, the same passage the clouds took to get there, to ask Reimu about her whereabouts, but in vain, she didn’t see her at all. Reimu knows what he has done to help her, 
meaning she has no reason to attack him. Having nowhere to go, he decided to stay at the shrine during the daytime, while still going back home during Gensokyo’s nighttime, only to still not find Sereinae there.

After thinking for a while, Reimu realized that this isn’t normal at all, after all, why would she leave for a while knowing she needs to go back home after being gone for over that many days? 
This sounds like an incident, but on a too small scale to be called so. They decided to take action and, since this recalled her certain memories of children getting supposedly kidnapped, she then looked for a certain door. 
On the way forward, she kept protecting Jolty to help him avoid harm.

Once they arrived at the Land of the Back Doors, they noticed Sereinae was trying to fly away from a woman sitting on a chair. They overheard the conversation, and the lady said 
“I know you have potential, I can sense it, though I’m disappointed even I can’t unlock it. As if there was a lock on it, meaning a key is required for it.”. 
Jolty wondered what she meant by that and decided to jump into the conversation, much to Sereinae’s happy surprise.

She explained how she ended up here : once she passed a door in the back of their building in the Dream City as a shortcut back home, she ended up in this land instead, with no way to escape as the door she took was locked, 
then two dancers and a “creepy lady” challenged her, even though she couldn’t fight back, making her forced to just survive their attacks, one after another. It was later revealed that this lady wanted her as a new servant to replace her current ones, 
especially after having seen how Sereinae dodged the bullets with a grace that isn’t that far from a dance. Still, the girl refused, deciding that she will always stay true to Jolty.

The lady then introduced herself as Okina Matara. She claims herself to be the reason why the dark clouds found their way into Gensokyo, through the door Sereinae took to get to Gensokyo and by extent the Land of the Backdoor. 
The secret god sees a strong bond between the girl and Jolty, then suggests they combine their powers in order for them to challenge her, making it essentially a test. 
She also insisted that Reimu shouldn’t partake within the fight as it would interfere within said test, and made her busy by making her face her two current servants. Sereinae saw them before, and admittedly guessed their outfits would fit her!
Once she can use her true power, much to Okina’s delight, seeing her potential finally unlocked, they then fight.

Upon winning, they passed the test, but Sereinae still stayed true to her decision and decided to go back home, only leaving Okina behind, disappointed. The girl’s final word to this is that if Okina wants it that way, 
the girl can still assist the servants once in a while, that is, if she asks her nicely, the thing being that, she can’t leave Jolty behind. 

The girl thanked the shrine maiden for protecting Jolty on their way here. Reimu didn’t mind about it that much, except for the fact she was left aside to fight the servants while the two others were fighting their bosses directly. 
Sereinae asked how she could make up for it.
This time, the girl didn’t hesitate and invited Reimu’s friends and other people so that she could share the food with others.

Sereinae Replica Event:

The canonicity about the past existence of the following character in Sereinae Létoile’s story can’t truly be confirmed!
It is confirmed in the Sereinae Replica’s story.

While Sereinae was doing one of her random Gensokyo tours, she stumbled into a house at the edge of the Human Village, the Serene Hostel. There she made a surprising discovery…

She met a girl who looked exactly like her, as if she was looking at a mirror, only the reflection had different clothes… The other girl who met her just greeted her the usual way, but something was wrong. 
Once the two introduced themselves, their first names happened to be the exact same!

They kept asking each other questions, for each answered question, the other Sereinae remembered more and more about her past… 
Sereinae Létoile is just any ordinary human, with a last name, but the one who stood in front of her is nothing but the creation of someone, but told nothing about who they are.
That creation not only got made from a bunch of Gensokyo characters, her appearance and personality are defined from someone else’s too! Realizing there’s absolutely nothing that can make her unique, her own self, 
she became so overly upset and thought in the end that only one of the two girls can exist… 

Even though Reimu tried to interfere, they both accepted their challenge, and fought against each other for the first and last time outside of 
Gensokyo for them to be unbound by the spell card rules, while keeping the shrine maiden away from it. 
Said shrine maiden wanted to save both of them, to her eyes, no one had to die, but she couldn’t. But unlike Sereinae, she couldn’t understand how the other one felt, that is to say, that the replica has to prove her right to exist
in front of the original, through combat. If the original refused, the replica wouldn't be alright with that.

There was one crucial difference between the two, one difference that made the original Sereinae stand out during the fight, and could make her a more viable servant… Her superior skills at dodging bullets. 
That gave her the upper hand in the entire fight. Her movements looked as if she was dancing frantically around the bullets, which was all that this someone wanted… 

Realizing the fake one failed at that purpose, and lost the fight, she had no choice but to go away for good, return the essence that made her to the Gensokyo characters, and her defined appearance go back to the real one’s. 
Before going away, the original girl still recognized the other’s skills at singing, and would like to get into it for her sake, and is sorry for the battle. Those characters can still retain a certain familiarity from looking at Sereinae’s face, but won’t ever be able to recall why. 
And after all, this isn’t a big deal for them. Reimu scolded Sereinae, yet the two Sereinaes wanted that clash to happen, and after all, she made those people a favor, by giving them back what is supposed to belong to them : their life essence.
Reimu realized something came back to her, and, that this fight was for the greater good. She couldn't blame the girl anymore, she was quick to forget about it anyways.

The real Sereinae then decided to make these events a complete secret from anyone but that shrine maiden, and took over the Serene Hostel, working it in, hiring people to work for her while she’s away. 
She has to keep it open after all! She also thought about making some business with the clothes she makes there, from time to time while working for the hostel side.

She has that lingering memory about having to take someone's life without being able to do anything about it.
She remembered the replica talking about certain dancers, twin dancers, she asked Reimu about them, and wished to see them. They were friends with her.
Once she got to the Land of the Backdoors, she offered to the Secret God to periodically help Mai and Satono, just as some sort of legacy of their relationship with the other Sereinae.

Some time later though, Sereinae planned one day to resign from her part-time job as a servant, she had cosplaying and making and selling clothes as a business after all. 
And...things seemed off to begin, that those three have a relationship that didn't really exist, it was with the replica after all, not the original. And they ended up learning about the original Sereinae being half responsible for the replica's demise at some point.
Yet, both Sereinaes looked like each other a lot, and behave the same way. It would take some time for the dancers to forgive her, unlike with Reimu. Who was the replica's creator in all of this?

Okina Matara ended up having to tell the truth about the replica because of this reveal, that it was her creation. Sereinae may have at first sensed some sorrow coming from the secret god for having lost her creation, 
she didn't sense any remorse from her for what she has done : giving life to a replica who suffered the fact she couldn't ever become someone who's not a shadow of someone else, and whose identity and life is taken from someone else's. 
This caused the girl to become more and more disgusted about Okina as time went on and was the true reason why she decided to quit, not her other hobbies and businesses, just this.

Okina made it clear that if Sereinae chooses to resign, then she wouldn't be able to use her doors to freely go to Gensokyo and see Mai and Satono again. While she didn't mind about the former, as she would likely find an alternate way to go to Gensokyo,
Sereinae still wanted to challenge her to a spellcard duel, where if she won, Okina would then have to allow Mai and Satono to see her again sometimes, just not to leave her behind, alone with Jolty. She couldn't blame them for having to obey Okina's orders.

Jolty's New Body Event:

Sereinae after a while was becoming tired to do everything in her house alone, with Jolty around not being able to do anything to help. She wished then that he had a human body to help.
She supposed that if Jolty is a disembodied human heart and soul, then that would mean he can host a human body himself.
Jolty responded that it would be immoral to just steal someone else's body to do it, and to that Sereinae agrees. He wasn't against the idea of having a human body, after all that time, having a body in starts missing him, in that world.

After brainstorming for a while, they thought about asking the puppeteer from the Forest of Magic, but she, being Alice, answered that she only makes puppets, and wouldn't be able to make it feel real even if it was human-sized.
They've tried doing their own research on the human body, if it required magic to create one for example, how to make a blank body which shape and flesh would adapt to the heart and soul inhabiting it. 
They gave Alice the idea about it in case they'd need to use magic. It would take long until they find an effective way to create one, gathering as much info and help as they can to make things possible, or understand the whole thing at the very least.
In the case everything failed, they'd get someone more experimented to do it for them.

Sereinae was amazed by the fact everything worked out in the end, although it took time for her to get used to his new appearance, she recognized him with his everyday attitude. She also thought by now that she could use some help from him, but she's going easy on him at the moment,
until he gets used to aiding her on his own.

Jolty now has a new body, he has one reason less to stay with Sereinae, but, after all the time they spent together, and the fact she still needs him, he decided to stay anyways.
He pointed out that with his new body, Sereinae can't use the fighting abilities from him that she uses. He suggested to teach her to defend herself in case he can't be there to help her, to which she replied that they're not in a hurry,
that when the time will come they will practice physical combat.

When they tried to go to Gensokyo, they noticed that they can't bring Jolty's body to Gensokyo through their newfound alternate way, that is, Wishing Portals, where they made sure that only the two of them can use them, fearing that curious people may abuse it,
much to the incident solvers' ire. They must also find a way to keep that body safe from eventual danger. Sereinae recalled another sage who can use gaps to get anything she wants easily, and they both wouldn't like that body to serve as food for youkai.
Jolty then had the idea of asking Reimu to put a seal over that body to repel the youkai while he and Sereinae are gone to Gensokyo. She only has to accept after all.

With an actual human body, Jolty now has to get a job of his own to provide for both of their needs. Sereinae doesn't abandon the idea of studying to become a therapist, and Jolty encourages it, as it can help them in their everday lives.
New job means temporary absence, and also the need for Sereinae to be able to defend herself on her own, This was the opportunity for her to train.
