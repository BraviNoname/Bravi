She didn't wear any headband but had one blue hairclip attached to the left bangs, and two pink hairclips attached to the right bangs.
Sometimes she wears a long red skirt with white boots instead of the pants and shoes.
She's later seen wearing an off-white shirt with a long red skirt, along with a headband, not wearing the hairclips.

In Gensokyo, after some time, she started wearing a short black and blue kimono, over her usual red skirt and white boots.

The ends of his sleeves have grey and lightblue diagonal gradient. The same applies for the bottom end of his pants. His pants also have horizontal light grey lines around the thighs and calves.

When his hood is up, his white glowy eyes can be seen. Due to him being camera-shy, he is rarely seen without his hood up, showing his face only to Sereinae most of the time.
When his hood is down, he can be seen having short black hair with a few spikes, short beard behind the cheeks and under the chin, black eyes with a slight grey glow, and a fair dark skin color.

Backstory and general information:

Lives in a city with an unrealistically beautiful starry sky and radiant daylight.
Although it resembles some european countries, notably some France cities, it isn't part of the outside world, but is in a completely different world. 
Therefore those unnatural and unrealistic sides of the city gave it its name as the Dream City, although this name has another deeper meaning...
It is also said to be located between reality and fantasy.

During her childhood, her ability prevented her from being a bully or a cruel person, as she would feel the sadness or anger of those she would target. As consequence, she also avoided bad emotions from others overall.
Serei's parents are somewhat strict with her, wishing for her to avoid bad company and being convinced (in this case, wrongly) that when at young age, children can be naive at times.
Later, she wanted to snap out of her attitude and instead tried to sympathize with the people around her, helping them set things right if she could. 
Sometimes just being a good emotional support can be a good thing for the people around her, so she became conviced that this is what she should do.
Consequently Serei has started doing some theater classes during her school days, to learn how to act properly when the going gets tough, and how to roleplay.
While she wasn't busy with class, she sewed clothes, though she still to this day buy some clothes : after all, making ones takes time, even if she's dexterous.

During her teenager life, she had more like a peachy personality, becoming friends with her classmates, well with the exception of those who judged her physical appearance, calling her chubby.
She never developed or engaged in any love relationship during that time. she didn't know how to properly approach someone who would eventually have feelings for her, or the other way around.

Serei wanted to learn how to live independently, so she moved away once she came of age. Her parents ended up choosing to believe in her, sensing that despite their worries, they need to let their kid follow their own path.
She agreed with her parents that she shouldn't stay with someone unless she knows they care about each other a lot. She doesn't care about short-lasting relationships at all. 
She now studies to become a therapist and have the best use of her main ability, or so she thinks. Her main studies help her understanding the human psychology better, 
and at some point she wanted to become a therapist, despite her parents' warnings. 

After parting ways with her friends after graduating from high school, she lived a solitary life, stayed in the city, and learned how to live independently as she wanted. 
She still studied and worked part-time, yet prefers focusing on her hobbies when she can, to relieve the pressure. Meanwhile, she keeps her parents in touch at times.
There are times where she wishes to go to other worlds to see more people outside her own. She has a curiosity about whatever's going on around her and beyond, so for now she travels around the city when not at home.

Her other hobbies include making new clothes, having a fashion sense due to the variety of clothes she makes and wears, either for cosplay or for sale, in this case, in freelance. 
She started cosplaying as what she calls "her favorite female characters", maybe to be in their shoes, and to try some different clothing fashions, and, of course, her theater classes helped a lot when it came to imitating those characters. 
She made clothes based on her simplistic style, but tends to vary a bit. She sometimes has difficulties with making very complex-looking clothes, them being either extravagant ones, ones with frills, 
or ones with very complex patterns, so she unfortunately can't please everyone.

She also happens to like reading at times, and had once thought about the job as an idol, but realized the job takes too much of her liberties, taking hold of even her private life, 
Besides if she wanted to, she wouldn't be able to, she doesn't have the beauty standards, according to the producers, to become one, with her not being slim enough to their liking.
She resigned to that idea, but still admires the idols' work. She thought that there's maybe another way made just for her to put a smile on people's faces.

Each time she ran errands, she stumbled multiple times upon a atypical being in the shape of an orb, with two white eyes.
Each time she did, she felt loneliness from this being. She turned a blind eye to it for some time, but ended up not to, her ability made it too difficult.
She saw it wandering aimlessly, and one day wanted to help him and was curious at the same time about it. If this was a time to practice with therapy with someone, it was right now.
She used that opportunity to learn how to control her ability and avoid getting overtaken by negative emotions. 
It has the ability to speak and one time Sereinae was surprised how it could sip a cup of tea without any hands or mouth. It complained about how people find it creepy and no one wanted him around.

Sereinae remembered about her current solitary life once she started moving out of home. 
On the long run, this kind of life has started affecting her negatively too, and started feeling somewhat unsafe, so she was able to sympathize with it.
Their loneliness is what brought those two people together. Sereinae then initially thought of it as nothing more than a pet, given how cute she finds it. 
Sereinae felt somewhat safe with that orb around, which in return felt understood when letting go of its thoughts with her.

After seeing each other several times, and getting things off their chests, they started becoming good friends, and decided to stay together. 

In exchange of allowing it to stay, she got lightning-based abilities from it. She jokingly said this would help with the electricity bill, and... she wasn't that wrong about it, honestly.
They got even closer to each other with time passing by, and later they became sidekicks. Serei has also given him the daily meals that he likes.
The orb introduced itself as the Spirit, a male one, he said this name would define him the easiest, but Sereinae didn't agree and found the name too generic. She decided to call him "Jolty" from now on. 
He guessed it corresponds to its ability and how shaky it sounds.

The reason Jolty had become bodiless soul wasn't clear. It was assumed it was a human before. When asked about it, he simply cannot answer, he doesn't remember his true identity, who he really is, his name.
When Sereinae asked, she sensed that he wasn't comfortable with talking about it, so she decided not to force things. 
 
During their daily life, she takes care of Jolty like in a sort of family. She made and wears a hair clip shaped after him as a special token of appreciation, and guessed it'd be nearly insulting to treat him like a mere pet.
With Jolty's influence, Sereinae grew a slightly nerd-ish side too, gathering more or less useful info about anything they want. With time they both take interest in each others hobbies, and started to visit worlds outside their own to expand their horizons.
She became encouraged in doing so with her feeling safe with Jolty around. She wanted to become knowledgeable like he is, making her a jack of all trades, sort of.
When she saw he is truly a human, she remembered about her vow not to form relationships during her teenage years, but since she knows they take care of each other, she can make this time an exception.
At one time she stopped treating him like a pet as a consequence, but now treats him as a person. 

The following takes place after the incident of the Dream City:

When they came to Gensokyo, Sereinae felt the change between an urban and a rural and wild area, giving her a refreshing feeling in her heart. She has seen people with extraordinary talents, which changed a lot between that and the ordinary life she had.
Well, that was mostly because she got attacked by youkai on first sight. After asking them, it was revealed it was because of her hoodie jacket made her look like an outsider.
She defeats them thanks Jolty's help, although dodging their bullets is very tiresome due to her sudden movements. She thought maybe she needs to exercise.
Jolty enjoys the trips they're having in Gensokyo too. After some time, he wishes to be able go back home, from homesickness. Sereinae felt the same, missing her home as time went on.
They don't really know how they could go from their world to Gensokyo. It was as Jolty deeply wished for them to go from one place to another, that they could, but that's a story for another time.

Later on they found a human settlement, the Human Village, Her offputting oufit made it clear that she's an outsider, but that didn't seem to bother anyone. 
Thinking the girl is homeless, some offered her to give her a temporary shelter. Jolty suggested that they shouldn't stay in Gensokyo for a long while, but to rather go back to their world when the sun sets and not later.
Sereinae adds that this isn't a place suited for staying for tourism, that they gotta have a good reason to stay, so she agreed with him.
She learned at some point that no youkai attacks those villagers. Remembering what a youkai told her about looks, she started to make and wear a new outfit to try to imitate those villagers. 

After some events transpired, Sereinae asks Mokou for guidance through the Bamboo Forest in case she needs to go to Eientei for medical matters. 
Mokou, at first, mistook her for her enemy Kaguya, but at some point after a good fight, they became friends.
Due to their adventurous and curious side, they also search info about whatever events or incidents that already took place, much to the people's fears that they might find too much out, 
but for them, it's like more like reading a story book while being less ignorant about whatever is or has been going on. But in truth, it had her grow the soul of a historian.

With all she has learned about Gensokyo's society, she avoids wanting to become the therapist of Gensokyo. If she helped her patients become more rational, knowledgeable, and how to deal with their fear,
she would in the end cause the decline of the youkai population, due to having less villagers fear them, thus a big incident. She made that a promise to the incident solvers that she would only help those in her world.
Jolty and Sereinae also vowed to make it so that they're the only ones able to traverse worlds from their own to other worlds, including Gensokyo. Jolty isn't sure that he can trust the other dwellers of his world to not make mistakes.

She proved that with knowledge comes wise decision making for the greater good, instead of a mean to an end for one's benefit. Besides, she mentioned how cruel it is to leave people in ignorance like this.
Jolty interprets this as how the food chain works, only this time, humans have something above them, which ironically, comes from them. Unlucky for them, they're born in a ranch from which they cannot escape.
Gensokyo is also somewhat like a place that is stuck in the past, to him.

She related to how people from the outside world get accustomed to Gensokyo's life style, such as the Moriya Shrine, and actually admires them for such feat.
She frequently asked them for advice, and visited the shrine. ...by wanting to climb the Youkai Mountain instead of taking the ropeway, thinking it'd be good for her health, much to the Tengu's disapproval and annoyance.
Jolty likes it when she cosplays as Sanae, so, Sereinae frequently wears her cosplay of her when at home, him associating the green, blue and white colors with serenity.

Sereinae sometimes wonders if this clothing holds more value than her own person to him. But Jolty replies that if it did, then he'd stay with Sanae, and that her clothing adds to Serei's appearance and person, rather than replaces those.
Sereinae doesn't want her cosplays to seriously change who she is: she still holds on to her person and changing it is not the purpose of her cosplay. In the cases where she changes her personality, then it's just some non-serious roleplay.

Jolty learned that the gods at the Moriya Shrine were planning to become gods related to technology, then bragged to Sereinae about the fact their city is technologically more advanced and more modern than whatever he saw in Gensokyo, 
but he still highly respects their projects related to such thing and guessed he could learn a few more things from them. 
Morally speaking, he wishes to view shinto gods as something similar to heroes, with them saving or helping people and getting praised for it. To him, that's one way to earn people's respect and faith, 
rather than to manipulate villagers into believing one normal aspect of their lives is something mystic. This latter case of faith is something he believes to be artificial.

Sereinae, on the other hand, got to talk with Kanako and noticed that she is different and more caring than Okina was, and supposed the gods aren't all the same.
She became friends with Sanae due to their shared interests and common knowledge from the world outside, although she noticed that Sanae is behind the times, after all it has been ages since Sanae left her homeworld, the Outside World,
but she didn't mind it as it made Serei and Jolty nostalgic. She jokingly said her meeting with Jolty might have been the fruit of a miracle, even though Sanae isn't sure if she did anything about it. 

They eventually met Sumireko at some point near the Hakurei Shrine, Sereinae and Jolty both noticed there was something off about that human, and got to know she's a doppelganger and the real Sumireko is in the Outside World,
they got along rather well, and unlike Sanae, Sumireko wasn't behind the times at all, and they noticed how much things have changed from back then to now in that world. 
They learned from those two girls a few things about Japan and its culture, which is something Serei and Jolty aren't familiar enough with, they're rather familiar with european or french culture.

While lurking at the Myouren Temple, Sereinae wish Byakuren to help her exercise for her agility skills.
This is most likely a sign of admiration to that monk, who can fly at very high speeds and become physically strong with her magic abilities.

Jolty once asked if Sereinae wanted to become a youkai for her physical limits, but she refused: she still dislikes her limits, but at the same time, she cannot afford to give up on her humanity and change herself forever, and guesses Marisa thinks like that as well.
She also mentioned how much of a hassle it would be for her to try to become one, that she would become a target for Reimu to exterminate, and that she has other things in life that matter (implying Jolty and their future). 

Serei and Jolty often want to challenge themselves, by trying to accomplish a given goal with little or none of Jolty abilities. 
He thinks it's a way for her to be less dependent on his powers, and Serei wants to hone her own physical and mental abilities.
Sometimes when Jolty is by himself he also wants to challenge himself. They know they're both insecure, and they'd like to do something about it.

For instance...

Jolty wanted to try to climb a certain mountain, although, it seemed that in this mountain's world, he cannot have his physical body. so Sereinae went along, 
saying she wants to do it for her health, and agility skills, so she made herself her not rely on Jolty's auto-dodge abilities to go around obstacles that easily. 
He admits that it'd be boring if she was able to do everything on auto-pilot.

She saw someone who, just like her, climbed this mountain, wanting to accomplish something in her life, but her anxiety pushed her back, and then it's only when she accepted it that she could move forward.
Thus they reflected on themselves. Understood that they do not have to challenge themselves or have the fear of losing, if doing that is not what makes them content in life.
It was also thanks to this climb that she started feeling sympathy for someone who looked just like her, but that's a story for another day.

The climb itself wasn't easy, the following sums up what they could do.

He had the idea of using his possession to grant her some additional strength to be able to climb walls or carry heavy objects. It was like they were climbing together with the two as one.
He granted her a dash imbued with his own lightning abilities and claimed he got some help from the magic of the mountain. It turned out that Sereinae became able to use it to its full potential.

At some point Sereinae had to climb high flat walls, and Jolty's lightning made her able to make her hands act like magnets on any surface, something Sereinae called a "ripple reference".
Any other survival-related abilities that would prevent real deaths was granted by the "miracles of the mountain", as he said, including when he catches her when she's about to get hit.
He pointed her hair change to green out, saying that this is one of them. This gave Serei an idea, to use these haircolor changes for certain character cosplays.

This gave her more ideas, as she found a way to dye her right sidelock according to the character's hair color. She considers it as making it less complicated when it comes to cosplaying as characters whose haircolor is too different compared to hers.
Then, she afterwards decided to make an extra effort and dye her hair with strips based on the character's haircolor. She wouldn't do any of these often though, as she likes having a single hair color with no variation.

Back to the main story, shall we?

After having difficulties finding his own path regarding a career of his own, and per Sereinae's advices, Jolty has started his own projects, where he can become an electricity provider with his abilities, 
or help building things around the city, revealing it's also a hobby of his of imagining a public transit, so he has to learn how to sell himself well as a freelance, and find a way to make his ideas a reality.
Sereinae, as one who likes travelling around the city, likes that idea, can't wait to see and support what he can do, and thus roots for him to try his best. She would also teach him one thing or two about how to be a freelance worker, and about physics.

He joked once that he'd make great rivals with the Moriya Shrine if he was able to produce energy all by himself for Gensokyo. Honestly speaking, it's not worth the effort, he has his own world to provide to.
But there's a possibility that the Moriya Shrine would use his powers as a source of energy, like they did with Utsuho Reiuji, and cold fusion. In the case this was to happen, Jolty just said "it depends".
With Jolty's plans, there would be no more need for Serei to rely on her parent's money or the sales of clothes, He now thinks she deserves some rest for taking care of both at home, it's his time to return the favor and become a provider too.

Sereinae didn't want to force him into doing it, but Jolty felt bad for her. He could just imagine themselves as the richest people of the world, with lots of money, or just enough to live, 
but he still has the need for himself or his thoughts and opinions to be useful or important to the people around him. Something his other self claims as nothing more than his ego.

Despite the fact Sereinae's eventual job as a therapist might emotionally weigh on her, to the point she reflected on her own naivety, she kept studying for the last year, per Jolty's encouragements, seeing that she can do wonders.
She understood at some point that she has sometimes to put her empathy aside, even slightly, to help herself have an impartial view of things, and not have her own ability weigh on her too much, and help move forward.
