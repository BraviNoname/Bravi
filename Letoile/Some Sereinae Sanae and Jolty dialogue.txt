Dialogues made between Sereinae LÃ©toile (Serei), Jolty, and Sanae Kochiya on a whim:

Sanae: Aren't you that creepy hooded spirit guy?
Serei: Sanae, you have a snake around your hair.
Jolty: And it's sentient. If that isn't creepy...
Sanae: Whaa-

Sanae: Hey, what's this hairclip on your hairband? Is that supposed to be your partner?
Serei: Yes, that's Jolty. It's thanks to him that I'm able to do this! *summons an electric orb from her hand*
Sanae: Jolty... Using someone else's power to... Is it like with Lady Kanako and Lady Suwako?
Serei: Oh, that's right. You use their support to battle like I do with Jolty, I guess we have that in common.
Sanae: You're copying me aren't you?
Serei: That I didn't really want to. It was for him that I made that hairclip. A token of appreciation.
Jolty: Yes. I find that... cute. *bashful*
Sanae: Whaaa- Where did you come from.
Jolty: Don't shrine maidens act as hosts for their gods?
Sanae: Yes, that's true.
Serei: Jolty, that means...
Jolty: Not yet, I'm still just a human. It's surprising how I can have something in common with a shinto god.
Sanae: What do you mean?
Jolty: For starters, it's like what I've said earlier. But I'm not an actual god, it's more of a title my other self gave me. Deep inside, I'm just a human.
Sanae: Do you receive faith from the people around you?
Jolty: Nope. If I was an actual shinto god, I'd vanish in an instant! Well, that is before I met Sereinae.
Serei: If I started believing he's a god, maybe he'd grow a shinto god part. And I'd become his shrine maiden.
Sanae: He would become just like me then! ...wait, wouldn't that make you another rival? *stares at Sereinae*
Jolty: ...no, you can keep your faith for yourselves, both your shrine and Reimu's.
Serei: Aw... Well, that's how it is. I assume it's because you don't have that hunger for faith that shinto gods have.
Jolty: *nods at Sereinae* I don't want to get in the way of those two shrines as well.
