Stage 6 Boss : Sereinae Replica 
Species : Human(?)
Ability : Drawing people's memories out

These events are alternate from that of the Létoile mod.
They take place before Sereinae Replica gets fired, unlike the Létoile mod.

Their raw battle style is very similar but that's because they're almost the same people,
but the Replica was so concerned about being her own person instead of being an imitation or a stolen life part, that she wanted
to prove herself to Létoile, but Létoile didn't mind at all.

=====================================
 
Phantasm Stage Boss : Sereinae Matara
Species : Human(?) (Normally) ; Half-Human, Half-God (possessed)
Ability : Replicating the combat style of certain people

Due to the many, many dialogue lines, I've been able to cover pretty much any information about her and Létoile in the dialogues,
so I won't talk much about it here. 
These events offer a good ending compared to that of the Sereinae Replica event from the Létoile omake.
