Stage 5 Boss : Sereinae Replica
Species : Human(?)
Ability : Replicating the combat style of certain people

The people of Hindrances are said to drive the Tengu away.
As Sereinae saw the incident was caused by one of them, she immediatly
disposed of her. But she forgot to ask her more questions 
about the incident and then ran out of clues about it.

Once the protagonists came, she drove Tsukasa away, and fought
the protagonists to test out the Ability Cards she bought against them.
She then suggested them to go further into the skies due to the unnatural Moon,
but fought them once again in the way, probably out of sheer rivalry.

============================================

Extra Stage MidBoss : Sereinae Replica

When she was chasing Tsukasa through the Rainbow Dragon Cave,
she bumped into the protagonists yet again, but had no clue 
they had the Blue Magatama Card, so she fought against them,
and they were doing surprisingly fine!
