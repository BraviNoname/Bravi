Stage 6 Boss : Sereinae Replica
Species : Human(?)
Ability : Drawing people's memories out

During the Four Seasons Incident, the Secret God tasked Sereinae
with facing any potential candidates that made the cut for a final fight. 
 
The fact is, that Sereinae wasn't aware that while these whole job
interviews were going, an incident was spreading across Gensokyo,
as she wasn't told by neither the Secret God or her colleagues,
to avoid making her instincts go against them and mess with the Secret God's plan.

Since orders are orders and she can't let herself be disloyal
to her master, she fought the protagonist nonetheless despite the confusion.
 
The wings she wore all along was only a way for her to be able to float...
The reason about the need of such a device is unclear, but it has a strong link
with disabilities and having an external tool to go around it. The same applies with her glasses. 
 
=====================================
 
Phantasm Stage Boss : Sereinae Matara
Species : Human(?) (Normally) ; Half-Human, Half-God (possessed)
Ability : Replicating the combat style of certain people

A few years ago, the Secret God thought of any way to get a new servant to
join her, a servant devoid of any "former life" for them to abandon, but the only seen
way for her to create a sentient being with her powers is to extract the energy from
either an object or a being, similarily to she did with the Komaimu statue where a sentient
being got created from its spirit, and the youkai herself seemed like a human version of
said statue. 

She considered a being would do fine, but only one wouldn't be enough to make the 
being unique or stable enough. So, she figured out extracting andcombining the life energy 
parts of many people into one would do it. 
Once it worked, the newly-created girl had the combined personalities and instincts
of these people, though it should be noted that she dreams of their life experiences
every night, due to her brain choosing to store these informations in those dreams. These informations
allow her to know about them, understand them, and respect them, as well as being able
to re-create the way they fight, alas she could only imitate one at a time...

When the protagonists seemingly defeated Sereinae, she decided to flee and use her master's
powers to expell them from the city in which they fought, back to Gensokyo, and that too,
was her master's orders, along with the use of the season door trap, used to take out all of
their weapons.

When they met her again, Sereinae was exhausted from their previous long fight,
but once she saw they wanted to fight for good and built the countermeasures, she felt the
need to go all out as well, but when that happened, the Secret God took hold of her body,
as if it was some sort of leash, still, that new form could make her able to imitate up to eight of these people,
it made her eyesight normal and made her able to float on her own.

This "leash" was put into place as some sort of hindrance to Sereinae, to avoid losing control of her power,
something she tries desperately to avoid but almost failed to this time. This deal is part of her training.
She also assumed these whole fights were all along just a test for her ability to control said power.

Once Sereinae got defeated, she fell into comatose and stayed at the Hakurei Shrine.
She swore she would end the incident by her own hands, as she felt responsible for not seeing through her master's plan.

For the trivia: the Nobody symbols that appear on the doors can be taken as a nod to the fact this Sereinae is a common shadow of many people. 
Therefore, a sort of nobody, and one can also combine that with the fact as an OC she doesn't exist in ZUN's canon.
