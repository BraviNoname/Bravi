Stage 5 Boss : Sereinae Replica
Species : Human(?)
Ability : Replicating the combat style of certain people

Sereinae's instinct to solve any incident drove her to seek about the chaos
caused by the animal spirits in Gensokyo.

When she faced the Sculptor God, her master, Okina, suggested to lend her help
to get rid of the animal spirit's mental possession. Once done, Sereinae
apologized to the Sculptor God and bumped into the protagonists, who were also
possessed. 

As she didn't want to see them like they are, and with a grudge against the spirits,
she fought against them, again, and again, for as many times as needed.
She believed the animal spirits were the cause of the incident, and when she
saw they gave an extra help to the protagonists, she assisted the Sculptor God in return.
