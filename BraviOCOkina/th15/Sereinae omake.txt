Stage 1 Boss : Sereinae
Species : Human(?)
Ability : Replicating the combat style of certain people

The same girl from the Hall of Dreams' Mausoleum was seen near the foot of
Youkai Mountain. Something in her instincts made her want to go to the Moon
ahead of the protagonists, but she got severely defeated for just one mistake.

To give herself a second chance, she tried to defeat the protagonists, nearly
taking them as rivals for the matter...

====================================

Stage 6 MidBoss : Sereinae

As she lurked behind the protagonists during their journey to the Moon,
and upon thinking for a while, she finally accepted what and who she really is,
she shouldn't let herself be troubled by what she really is, and should instead
be like just any human being from now on.

She sent the message to the protagonists, even if they didn't understand much
from it. She is in good terms with the divine spirit seen on the Sea of Tranqulity,
they both don't have a genuine identity, but that spirit can live without one just fine,
and that mentality is something Sereinae wants to learn from as well.
