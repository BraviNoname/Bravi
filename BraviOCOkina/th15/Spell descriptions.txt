Stage 1 Midboss (2nd encounter) - Sereinae:

Spell - Hard/Lunatic :
Star Sign "Sniper Star Mines"

Serein shoots stars that explode into gun bullets that are aimed, and shoots butterflies when they explode.

I wish bullet cap wasn't a thing there in the Lunatic version...

Stage 1 Boss - Sereinae:

Spell 1 - Easy/Normal/Hard :
Butterfly Sign "Star-shaped Butterfly View"

Serein shoots 5 rings of butterflies, giving them a star shape, while also shooting sets of seven green stars exploding into pink ones.

Spell 1 - Lunatic :
Butterfly Sign "Butterfly Tanabata View"

The butterflies and star explosions are now denser, creating this makeshift festival, reminiscing her creator's servants. Don't lose sight of the enemy's movement!


Spell 2 - Easy/Normal/Hard :
Book Sign "Scattered Pages"

Serein gathers a bunch of book pages that scatter all over the screen as a desperation move. Beware of the eventual star bullets that come by.

Spell 2 - Lunatic :
Book Sign "Scattered Book Mess"

The book page mess is much denser than usual. Still, the pattern is static, but the stars are now way faster, making them the main concern.


Spell 3 - All difficulties :
Light Sign "Bright Lights's Blizzard"

Serein shoots bright orbs, that, upon turning into lasers to snipe the player, shoot more bullets on spots. The delay and space between lasers and the density of the icicle bullets depend on the difficulty.

I wish having bullets turn into lasers didn't always recall Clownpiece... So I try to add my sauce to that spellcard.


Stage 6 Midboss - Sereinae:

Spell - All difficulties :
Link Sign "The Bullet that Reflects my Origins"

Serein fires bullets from her nonspell that bounce back down, reflecting the main bullet used by her opponent, and warning them of the tragedy that might come if they get hit even once.
