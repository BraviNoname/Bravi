Stage 1 Midboss (2nd encounter) - Sereinae:

Spell - Hard/Lunatic :
Star Sign "Sniper Star Mines"

Serein shoots stars that explode into gun bullets that are aimed, and shoots butterflies when they explode.
I wish bullet cap wasn't a thing there in the Lunatic version...

Stage 1 Boss - Sereinae:

Spell 1 - Easy/Normal/Hard :
Starlight "Pouring Starlight"

Serein shoots rings of butterflies, and those who hit the top edge of the screen transform into stars pouring down in the screen.

Spell 1 - Lunatic :
Starlight "Flooding Starlight"

The rings she shoots are denser, making the dodging of the stars and butterflies tougher and tricky. Don't lose sight of the enemy's movement!


Spell 2 - Easy/Normal/Hard :
Book Sign "Scattered Pages"

Serein gathers a bunch of book pages that scatter all over the screen as a desperation move. Beware of the eventual gun bullets that can randomly come by.

Spell 2 - Lunatic :
Book Sign "Scattered Book Mess"

The book page mess is much denser than usual. Still, the pattern is static and the gun bullets keeps the attention paid.


A third spell might come in a future update, eventually.
