Stage 1 Midboss (2nd encounter) - Sereinae:

Spell - Hard/Lunatic :
Star Sign "Sniper Star Mines"

Serein shoots stars that explode into gun bullets that are aimed, and shoots butterflies when they explode.

I wish bullet cap wasn't a thing there in the Lunatic version...

Stage 1 Boss - Sereinae:

Spell 1 - Easy/Normal/Hard :
Starlight "Pouring Starlight"

Serein shoots rings of butterflies, and those who hit the top edge of the screen transform into stars pouring down in the screen.

Spell 1 - Lunatic :
Starlight "Flooding Starlight"

The rings she shoots are denser, making the dodging of the stars and butterflies tougher and tricky. Don't lose sight of the enemy's movement!


Spell 2 - Easy/Normal/Hard :
Book Sign "Scattered Pages"

Serein gathers a bunch of book pages that scatter all over the screen as a desperation move. Beware of the eventual gun bullets that can randomly come by.

Spell 2 - Lunatic :
Book Sign "Scattered Book Mess"

The book page mess is much denser than usual. Still, the pattern is static and the gun bullets keeps the attention paid.


Spell 3 - All difficulties :
Light Sign "Bright Lights's Blizzard"

Serein shoots bright orbs, that, upon turning into lasers to snipe the player, shoot more bullets on spots. The delay and space between lasers and the density of the icicle bullets depend on the difficulty.

I wish having bullets turn into lasers didn't always recall Clownpiece... So I try to add my sauce to that spellcard.
