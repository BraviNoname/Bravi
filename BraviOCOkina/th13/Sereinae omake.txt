Stage 5 Boss : Sereinae
Species : Human(?)
Ability : Replicating the combat style of certain people

A mysterious girl seen around the Hall of Dreams' Mausoleum, her purpose in this
encounter was to vent about a certain revelation that was made about her.
She isn't a naturally born human, but this fact was a bit too much to handle for her,
making her want to intervene during the incident of the divine spirits against the protagonists.
 
It is not clearly shown in-game, but it seems her creator has some sort of relation to the one
sleeping in the mausoleum.
