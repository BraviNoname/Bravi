Like Mountain of Stoners, Subterranean Oparism or Legacy of Lunatic MetaPlate.\n            Okina's fight has the order of the seasons shuffled, and Mai and Satono drop too many ressources.\n            Keiki and Saki also seem to be affected by a curse, making them wrathful. This list is non-exhaustive btw."
