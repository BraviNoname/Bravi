Stage 6 Boss : Sereinae
Species : Human(?)
Ability : Turning a poetic phrase into a source of power

In an alternate timeline, Sereinae wouldn't have been able to master her
powers and her training to become one of Okina's servants led her nowhere.
The fact she was forced to renounce on said training forced her to have her memories
wiped clean by Okina, about her, her colleagues, and the people she met, including the ones she got created from.

She still retains her usual hindrances of her eyesight and her disability to float as a punishment,
and retains her usual personality, and her only power left is the one from her pocket book,
it holds vague knowledge about her former life, but she can't understand a thing from it.

The current incident got her curious though, with people using cards to have a part of someone
else's ability. Though this sounded familiar, she wasn't aware about the resemblance to what was
once something she could do as well, that is, replicating certain people's combat style,
so, she climbed the mountains up to the sky to investigate, and met someone that she doesn't know anymore, 
but they still had a friendly aura to her.

What made her relatable to Chimata's concept is the fact nothing belongs to her, she doesn't belong to Okina anymore,
her true identity isn't even hers to begin with, but that of those people, and what was once 
her knowledge about these people doesn't belong to her either.
