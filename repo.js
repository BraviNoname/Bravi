		"Bravimemes": "(Th10 onwards) (Select Bravimemes+ExpHP to remove bullet caps and make the game not crash when there's a lot of bullet cancels or enemy kills) Memes that come in my mind, and cursed patterns too... Like Mountain of Stoners, Subterranean Oparism or Legacy of Lunatic MetaPlate.\n            Okina's fight has the order of the seasons shuffled, and Mai and Satono drop too many ressources.\n            Keiki and Saki also seem to be affected by a curse, making them wrathful. This list is non-exhaustive btw.",

		"LetoilePlayerReskin": "(Every non-versus game) Just a lazy Sereinae Létoile reskin for all player sprites, just because she likes to cosplay. Includes haircolor change corresponding more or less to the actual character's when at full power (in main games from th13 onwards only, for now) thanks to zero318 and neo nickz. Not a custom shottype btw, that one kind of mod is for Létoile mod.",

Do not use this config on th13, it won't work like intended, use Letoile+OCOkina mod instead.",
