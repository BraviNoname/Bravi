	"patches": {
		"AllMarisa": "(Multiple games) Player sprites become Marisa, per texap0rte's joke idea.",

		"Bravimemes": "(Th10 onwards) (Select Bravimemes+ExpHP to remove bullet caps and make the game not crash when there's a lot of bullet cancels or enemy kills) Memes that come in my mind, and cursed patterns too... Like Mountain of Stoners, Subterranean Oparism or Legacy of Lunatic MetaPlate.\n            Okina's fight has the order of the seasons shuffled, and Mai and Satono drop too many ressources.\n            Keiki and Saki also seem to be affected by a curse, making them wrathful. This list is non-exhaustive btw.",

		"LetoilePlayerReskin": "(Every non-versus game) Just a lazy Sereinae Létoile reskin for all player sprites, just because she likes to cosplay.
